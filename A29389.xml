            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man is ſeiſed of Land in Fee, and, having two Sons, doth deviſe his Land to his younger Son and his Heirs, and if he dye without Iſſue (living the eldeſt Son) then the elder ſhall have the Land to him and his Heirs: the Deviſor dies, the younger Son had iſſue a Daughter, that dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue: then the younger Son ſuffers a common recovery with Voucher, to the uſe of him and his Heirs, and after deviſeth to another and his heirs, and then dies without iſſue, living the elder Son.</p>
               <p>Whether the Deviſee or the elder Son ſhould have the Land? was the queſtion.</p>
               <p>And the Counſell for the Deviſee raiſed three points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Admitting that theſe words in the Deviſe were omitted, <hi>viz. (living the eldeſt Son)</hi> whether the younger Son had an Eſtate-taile, or not?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether theſe words do make ſuch alteration of the Eſtate, as to make the Eſtate a Fee-ſimple determinable upon this contingency, <hi>viz.</hi> (if he die without iſſue, living the elder Son?)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Admitting that there were ſuch a Fee in the younger Son, yet whether this Eſtate deviſed to the eldeſt Son, be not deſtroied by the recovery?</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt point it was argued; that if theſe words of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
                  <hi>(living the elder Son)</hi> had been omitted, the younger ſon had had an Eſtate-tail by this Deviſe, the remainder in fee to the eldeſt Son.</p>
               <p>For although the Deviſe to the younger Son was to him and his heirs, which (in caſe the Deviſe had ſtayed there) had made a very good Fee-ſimple to the younger Son; yet when the Deviſor goes and declares further, and deviſeth, that if he dye without iſſue, that the elder ſon ſhall have the Land, this laſt limitation <hi>(if he dye without iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue)</hi> doth reſtrain the generality of theſe words <hi>(his heirs)</hi> to the heirs of the body of the younger Son only, ſo that the laſt Deviſe to the

And there it was ſaid by <hi>Hall,</hi> that if Land be given to a man and his Heirs for ever, <hi>Et ſi contingit ipſum Obire ſine haeredibus de corpore ſuo,</hi> this is a good eſtate in tail: and in the 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 74. by <hi>Vampage,</hi> If I give land to another and his heirs for ever in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Deed, and then after I ſay <hi>Quod ſi contingat,</hi> that if he die without heirs of his body, that it ſhall remain to another, in this caſe the Law intends by the <hi>Si contingat,</hi> that it is but an Eſtate-tail. And in the Book of Aſſiſes 14. Land was given to <hi>B.</hi> and his heirs, to have and to hold to him and his heirs for ever, if <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have iſſue of his body, and if he die without heirs of his body, that the Land ſhall revert to the Donor and his heirs. <hi>B.</hi> had iſſue which died without iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and it was adjudged that <hi>B.</hi> had but an Eſtate in tail, and becauſe he died without heirs of his body, it was adjudged that the Donor ſhould recover againſt the collaterall heire of <hi>B.</hi> And if the Law be ſo in Deeds or Grants executed in the life of the Donor, <hi>a fortiori</hi> in a Deviſe, which is to be taken more favourably then an eſtate made by Deed, and therefore it is ſufficient in a Deviſe to have the intention of the Deviſor underſtood, either to make an eſtate in fee or in tail, although proper words to make ſuch an eſtate be not uſed, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Deviſor cannot be more manifeſt to have an eſtate in tail then in this caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> As to the ſecond Point, the queſtion will be, whether the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Son hath an eſtate in Tail or in Fee determinable by this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? and it ſeemed to them that he ſhall have but an Eſtate in tail. In which, the queſtion is, to which eſtate theſe words of limitation, to wit <hi>(living the elder Son)</hi> ſhall be referred, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether to the Eſtate made to the younger Son, or to the Eſtate given to the elder, for if they be referred to the Eſtate made to the younger, there is no queſtion but theſe words do abridge &amp; reſtrain the eſtate, but if to the elder, then they make no reſtraint or reſtriction as to the eſtate of the younger Son, but onely limit the remainder to the elder Son on this contingency only, <hi>viz.</hi> (If he be alive at the time of the death of the youngeſt Son without iſſue.) And to prove that theſe words ſhall be referred to the eſtate deviſed to the elder brother; They ſaid, That if the land had been deviſed to the younger Son and the heirs of his body, and if he dyed without iſſue, living the elder, that the elder ſhould have the eſtate to him and his heirs; it is clear that the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath an abſolute eſtate tail, and that then the remainder to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall be on this contingency, <hi>viz.</hi> (If he be living when the younger dies without iſſue.) And ſo is <hi>Frenchmans</hi> Caſe, 1, &amp; 2. <hi>Eliz.</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed land to his wife for life, the remainder to <hi>Charles Frenchman,</hi> and the heirs males of his body, and, if he died without heirs males of his body, the remainder to <hi>Arthur Frenchman</hi> and the heires males of his body. <hi>Charles</hi> had iſſue a Daughter, and died without iſſue male, and it was adjudged that the Daughter ſhould not have the land, for this contingency does not alter the Eſtatetail that was firſt limited to <hi>Charles,</hi> and, although the Deviſe in the caſe at Bar be to the youngeſt Son and his Heirs without any limitation of his body, yet, the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54307:6"/> afterwards, to wit (if he die without iſſue) does explain well enough, that the heires of his body are intended, and then the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent words <hi>(living the Eldeſt Son)</hi> cannot alter the eſtate firſt given to the younger Son. And <hi>Hil.</hi> 40. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> by <hi>Walmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> If one deviſeth land to his Son and his heirs, and further deviſeth that if he die without iſſue, that the land ſhall be ſold, yet the Son ſhall have an eſtate in fee and not in tail, but otherwiſe, if he deviſed that if he died without iſſue, that the lands ſhould remain over, for in the firſt caſe, he diſpoſeth of no more of the eſtate by the laſt words, then he did at the firſt, but in the laſt caſe he diſpoſeth of the eſtate it ſelf in remainder. And this was agreed by <hi>Owen,</hi> 18, <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 354. and 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 330. where the caſe was, That one <hi>Edward Clark,</hi> being ſeiſed in fee of two houſes, had iſſue <hi>Henry,</hi> and two Daughters, <hi>Alice</hi> and <hi>Thomaſin: Henry</hi> dyed before the two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, living the Father, the Father deviſed one houſe to his daughter <hi>Alice</hi> and her heirs for ever, and the other to <hi>Thomaſin</hi> (who was at that time but eight years of age) and her heirs for ever, and if ſhe died before the age of ſixteen years (<hi>Alice</hi> then living) <hi>Alice</hi> ſhould have it to her and heirs, and if <hi>Alice</hi> ſhould die having no iſſue (living <hi>Thomaſin) Thomaſin</hi> ſhould have the houſe of <hi>Alice</hi> to her and her heirs, and if both of them died without iſſue, he deviſed the two houſes to the two Daughters of his Son <hi>Henry</hi> and their heirs, and if they died without iſſue, he deviſed the remainder to a ſtranger. <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That if <hi>Alice</hi> ſhould marry <hi>I.

And it was holden by three Iuſtices, that the daughters of <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould have it, becauſe that <hi>Thomaſin</hi> did not die within the age of ſixteen years, and that, it being objected that there was no eſtate tail to any of the daughters but a fee ſimple conditionall upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, it was at laſt adjudged 14. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>IN an Action on the Caſe, wherein the Plaintiff Declared, That he the fifth of <hi>July, 16 Jacobi,</hi> was and is ſeiſed in Fee of a Capital Meſſuage called <hi>Moor-place,</hi> with the appurtenances, and of 600 Acres of Land, meadow and paſture, in <hi>Petworth,</hi> with the ſaid Meſſuage uſed, of the annual value of 100 <hi>l.</hi> which Meſſuage he and thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath in the ſaid Meſſuage and Tenements, therein Farmors and Tenants, have time out of minde uſed to keep good hoſpitality for the relieving of the Poor in <hi>Petworth</hi> aforeſaid, and that in the Church of <hi>Petworth</hi> aforeſaid, on the ſaid fifth of <hi>July</hi> and alſo time out of minde, there hath been and is a little Chancel, on the North part of the Parſons Chancel in the ſaid Church; and alſo whereas on the ſaid day, and time out of minde, there were divers Seats in the ſaid little Chancel, and that the Plaintiff and thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath, time out of minde have repaired at their charges the ſaid little Chancel, and the Seats from time to time, as often as was needful: and by reaſon thereof, the Plaintiff, and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath, have for all the ſaid time aforeſaid, onely power, liberty, and priviledg to ſit in any of the ſaid Seats in the ſaid little Chancel, to hear Divine Service in the ſaid Church, and alſo to bury the dead bodies of any perſon whatſoever in the ſaid Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, at the pleaſure of the Plaintiff, and thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath; and for all the ſaid time have made convenient Graves in the ſaid Chancel, for the ſaid bodies, at their will and pleaſure: And that no other perſon, from any time ſince the memory of man, have uſed to ſit in any of the ſaid Seats, or to bury any dead bodies in the ſaid Chancel, without Licenſe of the Plaintiff, or thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath. Nevertheleſs the Defendants, intending to diſ-inherit the Plaintiff, and to hinder and deprive him of the ſaid liberty, the ſaid day, and from thence until the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 18 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> at <hi>Petworth</hi> aforeſaid: <hi>Praedictum Henricum ad ſedendum in ſedibus in Cancellula praedicta tunc exiſtentem, &amp; ad intrandum in Cancellulam praedictam ad Divina Servitia in praedicta Eccleſia de</hi> Petworth <hi>celebrata, audiendum, fraudulenter &amp; malitioſe impediverunt, per quod idem Henricus Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in Cancellula praedicta intrare, vel in eiſdem ſedibus ad Divina Servitia in eadem Eccleſia durante tempore illo celebrata audiendum per totum idem tempus ſedere non potuit, ad damnum</hi> 40 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendants plead, That <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the fifth of <hi>July,</hi> and long before, and always after until now, hath been, and yet is ſeiſed in fee of the Honor of <hi>Petworth,</hi> and of the ſaid little Chancel, as parcel of the ſaid Honor: and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, as ſervants to the ſaid Earl, lived in the ſaid Honor; and by the ſaid Earls command, the ſaid fifth day of <hi>July,</hi> and for divers other days and times between the ſaid fifth day of <hi>July</hi> and the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> as often as Divine Service was celebrated in the ſaid Church, did ſit in the ſaid ſeats at the celebration of Divine Service, which are the Impediments the Plaintiff did complain of.</p>

In this caſe it was argued for the Defendants, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was not good, becauſe that the Plaintiff did not ſet forth the manner of the Diſturbance, whereupon iſſue might be taken thereupon, but onely declares that the Defendants did hinder him from ſitting in the Seats, or to enter into the Chancel, which allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too general, to take any certain iſſue upon: And ſo in the 10 <hi>Ed</hi> 3. 39 <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> where one lets Land for twelve years, and for ſecurity of the term, makes a Charter of Feoffment, upon condition, that if the Leſſee was diſturbed within the term, that he ſhould hold the Eſtate to him and his heirs. And all this matter was found by the Recognitors in an Aſsiſe upon the general iſſue, and that the Leſſee was diſturbed: And this Verdict was adjudged inſufficient, becauſe they did not finde how the diſturbance was made. <hi>Vid.</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.

Return of a Reſcous ought to be certain to every intent, for that is in nature of a Declaration: And in the 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 47. <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> for divers treſpaſſes is not good, becauſe of the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Admitting the Declaration is good; It ſeemeth that the Plea in Bar is good, becauſe the Defendants have made a good Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Chancel is the Earls Inheritance, and that they did ſit there by his commandment: for although it might be true, that a Liberty to ſit and to bury there, yet he cannot reſtrain the owner of the ſoyl from the uſage of it: As, if one hath Common in the Land of another, or a Way, or other Eaſment, yet he cannot for theſe things, reſtrain the owner of the Land from making uſe of it. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 39. If the Defendant in a <hi>Treſpaſs Quare clauſum fregit</hi> the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> does juſtifie the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> which was the ſame <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> this is a good Plea, becauſe it may be the ſame <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> becauſe the day is not material: And 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 12. in a <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> for entry into his Warren, the Defendant pleaded that it was his Franktenement, and adjudged a good Plea as to the entry, becauſe he cannot enter into his own Land <hi>vi &amp; armis:</hi> but he was put to plead further as to the Chaſing. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26.

               <p>Reſolved by the Court, that when he was taken by the <hi>Capias utla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum</hi> iſſuing out of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> he ſhall be in execution for the Plaintiff preſently after the Arreſt, if the Plaintiff will, although his body was never brought into the Court, and although the Court did not commit him in execution for the party.</p>
               <p>Note, that in all Caſes when the Defendant may have a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> and the party Defendant is taken by a <hi>Capias pro fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> there the Defendant is in execution preſently, if the Plaintiff wil without any Prayer of the party, but when the Plaintiff hath Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lets paſs his time, ſo that he cannot preſently neither by <hi>Capias</hi> nor by <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> but is driven to his <hi>Scire facias,</hi> there if the Defendant be taken by a <hi>Capias pro fine,</hi> the Plaintiff muſt pray that he may remain in execution for him, but this cannot be done without ſuch Prayer. <hi>Vide</hi> 5. <hi>Rep. Froſts</hi> Caſe, 22. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 74. If one condemned for a Diſſeiſin, with force, or fees be taken for the Fine, yet he ſhall not go at large if the party prayes that he may remain for his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and in 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15 when the party may have execution without a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> the execution for the King ſhall be prayed for the party, and it is not materiall whether there were a <hi>Capias</hi> in the Originall, but otherwiſe if it be after a year. 2. <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. If one be taken for a fine to the King within the year, and the King pardons him, yet he may remain for the party. And ſo in this Caſe I conceive, that <hi>Gilbert</hi> was in execution for the party, and if he was not, yet the Plaintiff hath proved him in execution, from whence he eſcaped by the default
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54307:9"/> of the Defendant, ſo this Action doth well lye. Alſo the Plaintiff doth charge the Defendant with an eſcape, 13. <hi>April,</hi> 18. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> and the Defendant pleads an eſcape the 27. <hi>Febr.</hi> 16. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> which was a year and two daies before the eſcape alledged by the Plaintiff, to which the Defendant hath made no anſwer, and although he concludes that it was the ſame eſcape, which makes the plea good, where the time is not materiall, yet it is not in this caſe, for here it is admitted by the Defendant that the Plaintiff might have prayed him in execution ſo long as he remained in priſon, but it may be he made his prayer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>viz.</hi> between the 27. <hi>Febr.</hi> 16. <hi>Jac.</hi> and the 13. <hi>April.</hi> 18. <hi>Jac.</hi> as it may very well be in this caſe, and then the averment of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is nothing to the purpoſe. Alſo the Defendant ſaith, that he remained in Priſon from the twelfth of <hi>February,</hi> 15. untill the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> 16. <hi>Jacobi.</hi> during which time the Plaintiff did not pray him in execution, in which caſe the day is excluded by this word <hi>Quouſque.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And further declared, that the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> the Defendant the ſaid Warren in the ſaid places did break and enter, and therein, (without the licenſe of the Plaintiff) did hunt, and twenty Hares did take and carry away, continuing the ſaid hunting untill the firſt of <hi>March</hi> next after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further declared, that the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> 2. <hi>Jac.</hi> the ſaid Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant the ſaid Warren in the ſaid places did break and enter, and therein without the licenſe of the Plaintiff did hunt, and forty Hares and four hundred Conies did take and carry away, continuing the ſaid hunting untill the firſt of <hi>March</hi> following, <hi>contra pacem, &amp;c. &amp; ad damnum, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendant as to the <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> and to the firſt Treſpaſſe, (except the entring and hunting in the ſaid place called the <hi>Down,</hi> and the taking and carrying away the three hundred Conies) pleaded not guilty. And as to the entry, hunting and carrying away the ſaid Conies, he ſaith, that the ſaid place called the <hi>Down,</hi> is and hath been time out of mind <hi>Communis fundus,</hi> containing by eſtimation two hundred acres of Land and Paſture, and that before the ſaid tenth day of <hi>September,</hi> and before the ſaid Treſpaſſe, and at the ſaid time, the Defendant was ſeiſed of a Meſſuage and ſix Yard Land, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hundred and ſixty acres called the Mannor of <hi>Southbery,</hi> in <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> aforeſaid, and that the Defendant and all thoſe whoſe eſtate he hath in the premiſſes, time out of mind have had Common of Paſture in the ſaid <hi>Down</hi> for 200. and 40. Sheep, <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Couchant</hi> upon the ſaid Meſſuage and ſix Yard Land, and that the Defendant and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have uſed for preſervation of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as often as the ſaid Common hath been oppreſſed and troubled with Conies, have uſed of cuſtome to have liberty to hunt and to take the Conies: wherefore the Defendant the aforeſaid time of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid firſt Treſpaſſe, and for preſervation of the ſaid Common from ſuch oppreſſion and diminution aforeſaid, into the ſaid <hi>Down</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there hunted, and the ſaid Conies did take and carry away according to the ſaid cuſtome, and continuing the ſaid hunting all the ſaid time.</p>
               <p>And as to the ſecond Treſpaſſe, beſides the entry and hunting in the ſaid places called <hi>Harecombe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Harecombe Coppice</hi> and the <hi>Down,</hi> and the taking and carrying away two hundred Conies, he pleaded not guilty. And as to the entry and hunting in the ſaid places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſaith, that the ſaid places called <hi>Harecombe,</hi> and <hi>Harecombe Coppice,</hi> are Woodland, containing by eſtimation ten acres, and that he was ſeiſed in Fee of the ſaid Meſſuage and ſix Yard Land, and made the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54307:10"/> ſame preſcription as aforeſaid, for all his Horſes, Cowes, Heifers, Bullocks, and two hundred and forty Sheep levant and couchant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid Tenements, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Horſes, Cowes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the Feaſt of S. <hi>George,</hi> and from that time, untill the Corne growing in the Feilds of <hi>Moulford</hi> were carried away, and after the Corne carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for the Sheep, untill the fourth of <hi>March</hi> next after, and made the former preſcription for the Sheep in the <hi>Down;</hi> And the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription alſo for hunting and taking away the Conies as aboveſaid, and ſo did juſtifie the taking of the ſaid two hundred Conies.</p>
               <p>And as to the third Treſpaſſe (beſides the entry and hunting in the ſaid places, and the taking and carrying away of the ſaid four hundred Conies) he pleaded not guilty, and as to this plea he made the ſame preſcription as before, upon which plea the Plaintiff demurred in Law.</p>
               <p>And if this matter pleaded in Bar was ſufficient to bar the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff of his Action was the queſtion. And it ſeemeth to me that there is nothing in the Defendants plea to hinder the Plaintiff from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Iudgment. And the better to argue upon this matter I will firſt endeavour to ſhew what intereſt a Commoner hath in the Soile, and what things he may do upon the Soile, for preſervation of the ſaid Common.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether this be a good uſage and cuſtome to enable the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to hunt and kill Conies in the Plaintiffs free Warren.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, I conceive that he that hath Common in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers land, hath nothing at all to do with the Land any more then a meer ſtranger, but only to put therein his Cattel, and to let them feed there with their mouths, and it is not his own Common until his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel have fed there. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 10. The Owner of a Common cannot grant the Common to anothers uſe? <hi>Et</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 12. A <hi>Praecipe</hi> does not lye of a Common, for it is not my Common untill my Cattell have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it, and therefore that which another hath is not mine, therefore I cannot have a <hi>Praecipe</hi> againſt him who hath not that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and in the 22. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 48. and 12. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2. If a man hath Common in another mans Soile, and a ſtranger puts in his Cattell, there the Commoner ſhall not have an Action of Treſpaſſe, for although he hath Common, yet the Herbage doth not belong to him, neither can a Commoner do any thing upon the Soile which tends to the meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or improving of the Common, as to cut Buſhes, Ferne, or ſuch things which do much impaire the Common, neither can he make a Fence or Ditch to let out the water which ſpoiles the Common: But if he be utterly diſturbed of his Common, he may have an Aſſiſe, or a <hi>Quod permittat;</hi> and if any damage or annoyance be made upon the Land whereby he loſeth his Common, he may have an Aſſiſe.</p>
               <p>And as the Commoner may not meddle with the Soile, ſo cannot he meddle with any thing ariſing out of the Land, or that doth grow, or is nouriſhed by the ſame, otherwiſe then to have his Cattell to feed there, and therefore it is adjudged <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. <hi>Jac.</hi> that a Commoner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kill Conies there, but may bring his Action on the Caſe.</p>
               <p>But I agree that a Commoner may diſtrain Cattell <hi>Damage fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> becauſe their being there is a damage not onely to the Owner, but alſo to the Commoner, and a Commoner may abate a Hedge or a Gate that hinders him from comming to his Common: wherefore I conclude this firſt matter that the plea, as to that, is utterly inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54307:10"/> by the Law, if there were not a ſpeciall cuſtome alledged by the Defendant. And therefore it is to be conſidered, whether this preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption alledged by the Defendant to hunt and kill Conies there for preſervation of his Common, be good or no.</p>
               <p>And I conceive it is unreaſonable and not good, becauſe it is to the prejudice of the Owner of the Soile without any conſideration.</p>
               <p>And it is unreaſonable for two cauſes, firſt, becauſe it is too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, for the Defendant may hunt and kill as many Conies as he will, for he doth not claim to kill a certain number that do ſurcharge the Common, but generally (the Conies there.) Secondly, as this plea is, the Defendant makes himſelf his own Iudge to kill the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as often and when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is againſt Law, for it is to the deſtruction of the Inheritance of another, which no perſon can juſtifie by cuſtome or preſcription, unleſſe for the benefit of the Common-weal 13 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 16. It is Law to pull down a Houſe if the next houſe to it be on fire, and ſo the Suburbs of a Town may be pulled down in time of War, and if Enemies be on the Coaſt, it is good Law to come upon another mans Land, and make Bulwarks there; for the publick good is preferred before any mans private benefit.</p>
               <p>But when it is only for the private benefit of a man it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, 43. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>a.</hi> The Abbot ſaid, that he was Lord of the Town of <hi>A.</hi> and did preſcribe that when the Tenant ceaſed for two yeares, that he might enter untill he be ſatisfied his arreares. And it was held by the Court to be an ill cuſtome to put a man out of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, yet is that more reaſonable then this caſe, for the time when the Lord ſhall enter is certaine, and the time that he ſhall hold the Land is alſo certaine: and 19. <hi>Elizab. Dyer</hi> 357. A cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome that all Tythes let or granted for more then ſix yeares of Land in ſuch a Towne, was held void by the Court, becauſe it is contrary to reaſon and to the liberty of the eſtate of him that hath a Fee. And 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>B.</hi> Cuſtome in a Leet, that if the petit Iury do make a falſe Preſentment, and this found by the grand Inqueſt, they ſhall be amended: and it was held by the Court to be no good cuſtome, and againſt common right, but if the cuſtome were, that if the petit Iury concealed any thing, they ought to preſent them to be amerced, this may be a cuſtome.</p>
               <p>And to prove that Conies are part of the Inheritance, ſee <hi>Coke Rep.</hi> 7. in the caſe of Swans. But it may be objected that this uſage may have a legall beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was ſo agreed at the time of the grant, or creation of the Common.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That then it ought to have been ſpecially pleaded, for elſe it ſhall not be ſo intended as it is proved in the 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 28. <hi>Simon Eyres</hi> caſe, where a Cuſtome was pleaded in <hi>London,</hi> that if the goods of any man be pawned to a Citizen for a debt due to him, that he may detain them untill he be payed his debt; and it was urged becauſe that it may be good to bind the Debtor, becauſe it may be intended it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by his own grant, but it was ruled that it ſhall not be ſo intended, unleſſe it be ſpecially alledged.</p>
               <p>And that a man ſhall not be Iudge in his own caſe, is proved by 22. <hi>Edw.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>B.</hi> The Defendant pleaded that at another time he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to the Plaintiff in the preſence of <hi>A. B.</hi> &amp; was found in arrear, wherefore he was committed to priſon, &amp; there it was adjudged that the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54307:11"/> party himſelf could not commit him to Priſon, and that an Action of falſe Impriſonment did lie againſt the Plaintiff. And <hi>Cook R.</hi> 8. <hi>Dr. Bonhams</hi> Caſe. And in the 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>B.</hi> If one preſcribes, that if any Cattel be taken upon his Land damage feaſant, that he may diſtreyn them, and put them into the Pownd, until amends be made according to his own will: this was held not good, becauſe then he ſhould be his own Iudg, which is againſt reaſon.

               <p>Admitting it to be no Leaſe for years, yet is the Bargainor Tenant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> at will; and when he makes a Leaſe for years, and the Tenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he is a Diſſeiſor; and then when the Bargainor enters, he is Tenant at will again, and ſo the Bargainee may very well De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the Land.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt point, to make a Leaſe, the Law does require but the agreement of the parties, that the Leſſee ſhall enjoy the Land and take the profits, and it is not neceſſary to have any preciſe words of a Demiſe or Grant, as in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7.1. by <hi>Frieux.</hi> If I make one Bayliff of my Mannor for certain years, and that he ſhall have the profits without interruption, this is a Leaſe for years.</p>
               <p>But it was objected, that there is no expreſs words, that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> ſhall have the Land or the profit, but onely that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee ſhall not have it.</p>
               <p>But it was anſwered, that the words did amount to ſo much;<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> for when the Land is ſold to the Bargainee, by the Law he ought to have the poſſeſſion and profits: but when by the ſame Deed it is agreed, that he ſhall not intermeddle with the Land, it follows that the Bargainor ſhall have it, for he had it before, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to exclude him but onely this Deed: and although by the Deed the Land is conveyed to the Bargainee, yet when by the ſame Deed it is agreed that he ſhall not have the poſſeſſion, it follows that the poſſeſſion ſhall remain in the Bargainor, in whom it was before the making of the ſaid Deed, for no alteration is made thereof as to the poſſeſſion. As in the 8 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 34. one made a Feoffment, on condition that if ſuch an act were not done, that the Land ſhould return, &amp;c. and the Feoffor re-entered for the condition broken: and there it was objected, that his entry was not congeable, becauſe he muſt recover the Land by Action: but it was adjudged that his entry was good, and the ſame Law, if the words were, that for not performing, the Feoffor ſhould retake the Land.</p>
               <p>But it was objected, That it could be no Leaſe for the intertainty <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> of the time.</p>
               <p>It was anſwered, that notwithſtanding it was a good Leaſe:<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> for firſt, it is certain to continue until the time limited for the firſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54307:12"/> payment, and if that be done, then it is a good Leaſe until the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond payment; and is like to the Caſe where one lets Land for a year, and ſo from year to year, as long as both parties ſhall pleaſe: this is a good Leaſe for one year, and for every year after, when he hath entered before any diſagreement.</p>
               <p>And, as to the ſecond Point, it is clear that the Bargainor is in at the will of the Bargainee, becauſe he enters by his agreement; and then when the Tenant at will makes a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee enters, he is the onely Diſſeiſor; but if the Tenant at will infeoffs a ſtranger, then both are Diſſeiſors by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>And in the 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 12 <hi>B.</hi> If Tenant at will makes a Leaſe for years, this is a Diſſeiſin.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon hereof is apparent; for the Tenant at will hath no Eſtate in the Land, and therefore he hath nothing to transfer to another. And in the 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>B.</hi> If I let anothers Land for years, and the Leſſee enters, he is a Diſſeiſor: And 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>a.</hi> If Tenant at will makes a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee enters, this is a Diſſeiſin to the firſt Leſſor.</p>
               <p>And if the Tenant at will be outed by the Diſſeiſor, and re-enters, he hath reduced the Eſtate to the Leſſor: as in the Lord <hi>Abergevenies</hi> Caſe, reported briefly by the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> 173.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Judicium.</note>And after many arguments in this Caſe, <hi>Hillar.</hi> 20 <hi>Jacob.</hi> the Court agreed that the Demiſe was good; and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>TEnant in Socage had iſſue by his firſt Wife, <hi>Joan, Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Agnes,</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by his ſecond Wife, <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Mary, William,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> by his third Wife; and by his Will did Deviſe his Land to <hi>Joan</hi> the younger for her life, rendering 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Rent to <hi>William,</hi> the remainder to <hi>William</hi> in Tayl, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> for life, the remainder <hi>propinquo ſanguinitatis</hi> of the Deviſor for ever. <hi>William</hi> dyes without iſſue, <hi>Joan</hi> the younger dyes without iſſue, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had iſſue <hi>William Stokes,</hi> and dyes; <hi>Mary</hi> had iſſue <hi>William Pierce,</hi> and dyes; <hi>Joan</hi> the elder dyes, having iſſue <hi>John Periman</hi> and <hi>William Periman; Agnes</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> dye without iſſue: <hi>John Periman</hi> had iſſue, <hi>John Periman</hi> the Leſſor, and dyes; <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> dye, <hi>Katherine</hi> dyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had iſſue <hi>George Dean</hi> and <hi>John Dean; Elizabeth</hi> deviſeth her Land to <hi>John Dean</hi> and his Heirs, and dyes: <hi>John Dean</hi> hath iſſue <hi>John Dean,</hi> and dyes: the Leſſor enters, and makes a Leaſe to the Plaintiff, who enters and is ejected by the Defendants, by commandment of the ſaid <hi>John Dean</hi> the ſon, upon which the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff brought an Ejectment.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemeth to me that judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff for all the Land, or at leaſt for part thereof.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the firſt place I conceive, that when <hi>William</hi> the ſon dyed without iſſue, the remainder in fee did veſt in <hi>John Perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who was the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Joan</hi> the elder, who was the eldeſt daughter of the Deviſor: for although the Deviſor had many
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54307:12"/> daughters, yet his intent appeared in the Will to a ſingle perſon, and not to divers: alſo it appears, that he doth not intend that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhould veſt in <hi>William</hi> his ſon, for he deviſeth to him a Rent during the life of <hi>Joan</hi> the younger, and afterwards an Eſtate. Tail cannot be in <hi>Joan</hi> the younger, or any of her iſſues, becauſe that an expreſs Eſtate for life is limited to her; nor in <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or <hi>Mary,</hi> for he deviſeth a remainder to them for life; nor in any other of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for then he would have named them either by their proper names, or as his daughters, and not by ſuch circumlocution as is pretended in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the words of Remainder in fee cannot extend to thoſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for they are <hi>proximae conſanguinitatis,</hi> which does clearly exclude his own ſons and daughters, for they cannot properly be termed to be of conſanguinity of the blood of the father; as it is ſaid in Sir <hi>William Herberts</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cooks Rep.</hi> 3. that <hi>filius eſt pars patris,</hi> and this is proved by the uſual pleading of a Deſcent; for if the Plea be by any, except ſon or daughter, the form is to ſay, That the Land deſcends to him as Coſin and Heir, and ſhall ſhew how; but if by the ſon or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to plead as before. And 30 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 47. Land was deviſed to one for life, the remainder to another for life, the remainder <hi>propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quioribus haeredibus de ſanguine puerorum</hi> of the Deviſor: there it is agreed that the ſons and daughters are excluded by that Deviſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo here in this Caſe, neither <hi>William</hi> the ſon, nor any of the daughters of the Deviſor, can take any thing by this Deviſe; for they cannot be ſaid, <hi>de Conſanguinitate de ſanguine</hi> of the Deviſor, but the Iſſues of the Children of the Deviſor are comprized within theſe words. And then I conceive that the limitation being in the ſingular number, <hi>viz. proximo conſanguinitat.</hi> all the iſſues of thoſe Children ſhall not take, but one onely, and that as I conceive ſhall be the eldeſt ſon of the eldeſt daughter of the Deviſor, which was <hi>John Periman,</hi> father of the Leſſor of the Plaintiff; as in the 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 23. In an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſuppoſing the Defendant to be his Receivor from the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> it ſhall be taken to be the principal Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, and not the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael in Monte Teneb.</hi> And 13 <hi>H</hi> 4. 4. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 68. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 29. If father and ſon be of one name, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of <hi>J. S.</hi> If <hi>J. S.</hi> be named generally in a Writ, Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Deed, it ſhall be intended the father, for that he is moſt worthy. And ſo <hi>Pladwels</hi> Caſe in this Court, <hi>Mich.</hi> 38 and 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> If a woman hath a Baſtard and two legal iſſues, and Land be given to one for life, the remainder to the eldeſt iſſue of the woman, the eldeſt legal iſſue ſhall take, and not the baſtard, although he be the eldeſt iſſue, for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words ſhall always be taken in the moſt worthy ſence.</p>
               <p>And ſo here, the Deviſor did diſpoſe of his Eſtate to <hi>Joan</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, rendering Rent to <hi>William</hi> his ſon, the remainder to <hi>William</hi> in Tail, the remainder to two of his daughters, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> for life, the remainder <hi>proxim. conſanguin. &amp;c.</hi> in fee: By which words it is apparent, that the Deviſor intended, that for the default of the iſſues of <hi>William,</hi> and after the death of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> the Eſtate ſhould remain to one who was next of blood to him, and that is <hi>John Periman</hi> the eldeſt ſon of his eldeſt daughter.</p>
               <p>But admitting that all the iſſues of the daughters ſhall be in equal degree to take by this remainder, as well as the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Joan</hi> the eldeſt daughter; yet I conceive that thoſe daughters, who had an Eſtate deviſed to them by Will, are excluded. <hi>Cooks</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 95. <hi>B.</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54307:13"/> Always the intention of the Deviſor expreſſed in his Will, is the beſt Expoſitor and Director of his words: and therefore if Land be deviſed to one <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> this ſhall paſs a fee, although it be otherwiſe in a Grant: So if one deviſeth Land to another, to diſpoſe of, or ſell at his pleaſure, this is a fee to the Deviſee. <hi>Litt.</hi> 133. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>B.</hi> And ſo in our Caſe, the intent of the Deviſor appears, to diſpoſe of his Land among his Children and their iſſues: as in <hi>Trin.</hi> 38 <hi>Eliz. Ewre</hi> and <hi>Heydons</hi> Caſe. <hi>Heydon</hi> was ſeiſed of a Meſſuage in <hi>D,</hi> and of three houſes and certain Land in <hi>Watford,</hi> did deviſe his Meſſuage in <hi>D,</hi> and all his Land in <hi>Watford;</hi> it was judged the houſes in <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> did not paſs, in regard of the expreſs mentioning the houſes in <hi>D.</hi> and this was affirmed in a Writ of Error.</p>

                  <head>The Caſe.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RIchard Davis,</hi> being ſeiſed of Land in fee, did acknowledg a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Merchant of 500 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Richard Machin,</hi> to be payd to the Conuſee, &amp;c. without expreſſing any day of payment; the Conuſor made a Leaſe of the Lands to <hi>E</hi> for years, who grants his Eſtate to <hi>B;</hi> the Conuſee dyes inteſtate, and his Adminiſtrator extends the Land, whereupon the Aſſignee of the Term brings his <hi>Audita Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rela.</hi> And whether the <hi>Audita Querela</hi> will lie or not? was the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>And I conceive that it will not lie: In which the Queſtion is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether this Statute, being without an expreſs day of payment, be good or not, and warranted by the Statutes of <hi>Acton-Burnel, &amp; de Mercatoribus,</hi> or not?</p>
                  <p>And I conceive this is a good Statute, and well warranted by the ſaid Statutes.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, the intention, ſcope, and purpoſe of this Statute is to be conſidered; and that was, as I conceive, to provide ſpeedy remedy for Merchants, as well Foreigners as Natives, to receive their Debts: and this is grounded on very good reaſon; for Merchants are neceſſary members of the publique good; for by them and their Trade, the King hath profit by his Cuſtoms: 2. The King and his Subjects have Foreign Commodities for their neceſſary uſe: 3. They are the means of uttering the Commodities of this Land in Foreign parts: 4. The Subjects of the King are educated and inſtructed in Navigation. And the neceſſity of Merchants, and their good uſage, appears in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> 30. <hi>Omnes autem Mercatores niſi publice antea prohibiti fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, habuerunt ſalvum &amp; ſecurum conductum exire de Anglia, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire in Angliam, &amp; morare, &amp; ire per Angliam tam per terram, quam per aquam, ad emendum vel vendendum, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe their repair into this Land was ſo neceſſary, theſe Statutes were made to give them ſecurity and remedy for their Debts ariſing for the ſale of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes: and this is the whole ſcope and purpoſe of the Statute.</p>
                  <p>And to examine the parts of theſe Statutes, I conceive that ſome parts of this Statute are ſubſtantial and material, and therefore ought preciſely to be obſerved: and ſome are not ſo ſubſtantial; and this of the day is ſuch a one.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, the Debtor ought to come before the Major or other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Clerk appointed, to take t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He muſt there acknowledg the Debt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Recognizance muſt be inrolled. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Clerk ought to make a Writing obligatory. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ought to be ſealed with the Seal of the Debtor, and the Seal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> appointed by the King, which by the laſt Statute ought to be of two parts, whereof one is to remain with the Major or other Officer, and the other with the Clerk.</p>
                  <p>There ought to be a time of payment, and this ought to be ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that the Major, by view of the Roll, may certifie, that the time is paſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to the other parts not ſubſtantial:</p>
                  <p>Although the Statutes appoint the taking of the Statute before the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Maior, or other chief Officer, in the ſingular number; yet the ſame may be done before any two chief Officers, as it is uſual in many Towns.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54307:15"/>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Although the Statute ordains the inrolment, and the writing to be of the proper hand of the Clerk, yet it may be written by his Clerk or ſervant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Although the time of the payment be limited by the Statute to be at a day certain, yet it is ſufficient if the time be certain, although no particular day be expreſt in the Statute.</p>
                  <p>But all the firſt ſix matters being of ſubſtance, ought to be obſerved, as in <hi>Trinit.</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in this Court, between <hi>Worſly</hi> and <hi>Charnock,</hi> a Statute acknowledged which had but one piece of the Seal, adjudged voyd; and the ſame adjudged in the Caſe of <hi>Aſcue</hi> and <hi>Hollingworth, Trin.</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 343. and this is upon very good reaſon: for when the King hath committed the Cuſtody of the Seal to two, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to the Major and the Clerk, and to each a part, the part committed to one is not ſufficient. And all the other aforeſaid ſubſtantial parts are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial parts of the ſaid Statute, except the writing of the Statute with the proper hand of the Clerk.</p>
                  <p>Then the Queſtion in this Caſe is no more, then if there be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time limited for the payment, and ſuch a time as the Major may certifie to be incurred, in caſe it be ſo required: And I conceive there is; for when he acknowledgeth the Debt to be due, and no time is expreſſed, the Law appoints the payment to be immediately, and that is ſuch a time as the Major by his Certificate may take notice of. 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>a.</hi> If a Bond be made, and no day of payment therein limited, it is due preſently, 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4 49. <hi>B.</hi> 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 22. but he ſhall not recover damages without demand. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 29. 6. If one be bound in a Bond, and no day of payment be limited, and then the Obligor is bound in another Obligation to pay the mony at a day certain, if the mony be not payd at the day, he forfeits his ſecond Bond, and yet by the firſt Bond it was not payable before requeſt: But that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is, becauſe, as I conceive, that he ſhall recover no damages before requeſt, but the mony is due preſently: and when the Law appoints a time certain, that is as good as if it had been expreſt in the Bond it ſelf: As in the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. where it is ordained, that in a Writ of <hi>Mortdanceſter,</hi> the Demandant ſhall count of the ſeiſin of his Anceſtor from the time of the Coronation of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third: Yet if an Infant brings a <hi>Mortdanceſter</hi> of the ſeiſin of his Father or Mother, he need not alledg this in his Writ, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the Court. 16 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.47.

                  <p>And if the Statute had been in the hundred hour, or the thouſand hour, after the making thereof, here is no day limited; and yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that no body will doubt, but that this is a good Statute. <hi>Cook.

If one having authority to make Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, reſerving the uſual Rent, does let Land, whereof the ancient Rent was a Quarter of Corn, reſerving eight Buſhels, this is a good Leaſe: for the Law reſpecteth not the forms of words, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and effect of the matter.</p>

                     </label> But it may be objected, That if the Statute doth not mention a day of payment, it is to no purpoſe to acknowledg ſuch a Statute; for if the mony be payable preſently, the Debtor may pay the mony, and ſpare the making of the Statute.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54307:15"/>
                  <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> that the Statute intends onely to provide aſſurance to the Merchant for his debt, and not to give any day of payment to the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but to leave that to the agreement of the parties, and when the Merchant hath delivered his Goods, there is reaſon he ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſecurity, and not preſent payment for them, unleſs it be otherwiſe agreed amongſt themſelves, but if they agree upon a day of payment, that may be put into the Statute, or elſe to have a Defeaſance, but this is not of neceſſity. There is a Rule in Law, that every Leaſe ought to have a certain time of beginning, and alſo of ending, yet if one makes a Leaſe for twenty years and does not ſay when it ſhall commence, this is a good Leaſe, for the Law will ſuppoſe the Leaſe to begin preſently.</p>
                  <p>And it is ordered by the Statute, that the Writing obligatory ſhall be written with the proper hand of the Clark, yet it is a good Statute although it be written by his Servant, but otherwiſe in caſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to revoke, as in <hi>Coke Rep.

                  <p>Furthermore theſe Statutes being taken for aſſurance of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſhall be expounded favourably for them, ſo far as the variance (if any be) of the Letter, ſhall not impeach it, 5. <hi>Rep.</hi> 77. <hi>a,</hi> 21. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 18. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 67. 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 10. 4 <hi>Rep.

                  <p>And the form of the Statutes in <hi>Gloceſter, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and many other Towns, is to mention no day of payment, but ſome are made <hi>Sine ulteria dilatione,</hi> ſome <hi>Immediate,</hi> but the moſt uſuall do run as in our caſe, and the formes of Preſidents are much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p>As in the <hi>Comment.</hi> 163. <hi>Frogmorton</hi> againſt <hi>Tracy,</hi> Two Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices held that an Avowry by the Defendant was not good without averment, as ought to be in every Plea, but when all the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were ſhewn without averment, they were ſatisfied. And the ſame caſe is put in the <hi>Comment.</hi> 320. <hi>B.</hi> for a Rule that the Records of every Court are the moſt effectuall proofs of the Law of things treated in that Court: and in the 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30. In a Writ of Meſne, the Tenant ſhewed the Tenure only between the Meſne and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and not the Tenancy, between the Meſne and the Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, wherefore the Iudges held the Plea naught: but when they had ſeen the Book of Preſidents, wherein it was uſuall to omit this, they changed their opinions, and ſaid that they would not alter the Preſidents.

                  <p>And the Statute provides only for Merchants for their debts, and yet none will deny, that if ſuch a Statute be acknowledged to one who is not a Merchant, or never uſed Merchandizes, yet it is good.</p>

                  <p>And I conceive that by the Statute of the 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> this Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance may be extended againſt the Son, the words of which Statute are; <hi>And be it further enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that if any perſon or perſons have heretofore, ſithence the beginning of the Queens Majeſties Reign that now is, made, or hereafter ſhall make any convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Gift, Grant, or Demiſe, Charge, Limitation of Uſe or Uſes, or Aſſurance of, in or out of any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, with any Clauſe, Proviſion, Article, or Condition of Revocation, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination or alteration, at his or their will or pleaſure, of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, Aſſurance, Grants, Limitation of Uſes or Eſtates, of, in or out of the ſaid Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, or of, in, or out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part or parcell of them, contained or mentioned in any Writing, Deed, or Indenture of ſuch Aſſurance, Conveyance, Grant, or Gift, and after ſuch Conveyance, Grant, Gift, Deviſe, Charge, limitation of Uſe or Aſſurance ſo made or had, ſhall or do bargaine, ſell, demiſe, grant, convey, ſell, or charge, the ſame Lands, Tenements, or Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments, or any part or parcell thereof, to any perſon or perſons, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Politick, or Corporate, for money or other good conſideration paid or given, the ſaid firſt Conveyance or Aſſurance, Gift, Grant, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Charge, or Limitation not by him or them revoked, made void, or altered, according to the power and authority reſerved or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto him or them, in and by the ſaid ſecret Conveyance, Aſſurance, Gift, or Grant.

               <p>The Attorney Generall for the King did reply, that before the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>ſc.</hi> 9 <hi>Octobr.</hi> 19. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> and long before, and continuing after untill the exhibiting of this information, the Defendant, the Park and Tenements aforeſaid, with Ditches, Hedges, and Fences had ſo ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incloſed, that the Kings Deer of the aforeſaid Foreſt for defect of ſufficient incloſing of the Park and Tenements aforeſaid, through the default of the Defendant did enter, and the Deer of the King into the ſaid Park and Tenements aforeſaid, for the cauſe aforeſaid, entring, the Defendant did very unjuſtly kill the ſaid Deer in the ſaid Park and Tenements aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The Defendant did maintain his Bar, and traverſed without that, that the Defendant the Park and Tenements aforeſaid with ſuch ſleight Fences, Hedges, and Ditches incloſed did keep the ſame, <hi>Quod Damae Regis de forreſta praedicta de tempore in tempus intra tempus praedictum in parcum &amp; tenementa praedicta pro defectu ſufficientis inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurae parci &amp; tenementorum praedictorum in defectu defen. intraverunt, abſque hoc quod Defendens Damas Regis de forreſta praedicta in parco &amp; tenementis praedictis pro defectu ſufficientis incluſurae parci &amp; tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Attorney demurred.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given for the King. Firſt, Becauſe the plea in Bar and the Rejoynder made by the Defendant is altogether inſufficient for divers cauſes. Secondly, As to matter in Law.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, The <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> doth ſuppoſe that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did uſe the liberties there mentioned within the Mannor of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> being within the meets and bounds of the Foreſt of <hi>Sherwood,</hi> and within the Reguards of the ſaid Foreſt, and the Defendant did know this to be within the meets and bounds of the ſaid Foreſt, but does not anſwer whether it be within the Reguards or not, for it may be within the meets and bounds of the ſaid Foreſt, and yet not within the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards: as if the Mannor were disforeſted by <hi>Carta foreſtae,</hi> becauſe it was a Subjects Mannor and not the Kings, yet it remains within the meets and bounds of the ſaid Foreſt, but not within the Reguards, for now by the disforeſting it is made purlue, and not ſubject to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards and Lawes of the Foreſt, as to the Owner of the Mannor. <hi>Vide Carta Foreſta fol.</hi> 1. and yet notwithſtanding this Statute, if the King had granted this Mannor to be free of the Reguards, or out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, yet is it ſtill within the meets and bounds of the ſaid Foreſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Dendant makes Title to the liberties whereof Sir <hi>John Byron</hi> his Grandfather was ſeiſed in Fee, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Meſſuage, a hundred acres of land, two hundred of Meadow, three hundred of Paſture, and a hundred of Wood in <hi>Colwick,</hi> now and time out of mind called the Mannor of <hi>Colwick, Quodque ille &amp; omnes illi Quorum ſtatum idem Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes habuit in tenementis praedictis, habuerunt, tenuerunt, &amp; habere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueverunt in praedictis</hi> 200. <hi>acris paſturae &amp;</hi> 100. <hi>acris boſci parcellis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorum tenementorum, vocat. mannerium de Colwick, praedictum par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, tenementa praedicta, vocat. mannerium de Colwcik, ſpectant. &amp; pertinent. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Defendant doth not preſcribe, but doth alledge only that Sir <hi>John Byron,</hi> and thoſe whoſe eſtate he hath, have uſed to have a Park, the which is no Title to the Park, for that ought to be time out of mind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Defendant doth claim to have a Park in the aforeſaid two hundred acres of paſture, and a hundred acres of wood, whereas there is no ſpeaking of two hundred acres of paſture before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought to have ſaid, in two hundred acres of paſture parcell of the ſaid three hundred acres.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Defendant doth not anſwer to the killing of the Kings Deer of the Foreſt, but doth only juſtifie the killing of all Deer time out of mind being in the ſaid Park.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Rejoynder is a manifeſt departure from the Bar, for in the Bar he claimeth to have a Park ditched and hedged, <hi>Per volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem eorum incluſum,</hi> ſo that by this pretence he may keep the Park with ſuch low Hedges as he will, and yet in his Rejoynder he doth tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that he kept the Park <hi>adeo parvis ſepibus &amp; Foſſatis, quod Damae Regis de foreſta praedicta in parcum praedictum pro defectu incluſurae intraverunt, &amp; abſque hoc, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Defendant by his Rejoynder doth make an Iſſue upon that which he doth juſtifie in his Bar, and doth, upon the matter, deny in his Rejoynder, the matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him in his Bar.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54307:18"/>
               <p>And, as to the matter in Law, I conceive that the Defendant cannot preſcribe to have a Park in ſuch manner as he pretendeth, for that ſuch preſcription is quite contrary to the nature of his Royall Franchiſe of his Foreſt, and is to the deſtruction of it, for a Foreſt is a Royall Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, ſo that regularly none can have it but the King, as it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in this Court in a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt <hi>Humphrey Bigges.</hi> And <hi>Manwood fol.</hi> 1. A Foreſt is a certain Territory of Ground pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged for wild Beaſts and Fowles of the Foreſt to reſt and abide in the ſafe protection of the King, for his Princely delight and pleaſure, and doth conſiſt of four things. 1. Vert. 2. Veniſon. 3. Particular Laws and Priviledges, 4. Certain Officers.</p>
               <p>But by this pretence of the Defendant, the Foreſt of the King is priviledged for wild Beaſts to reſt in protection of the King, but they are ſubject to being deſtroyed by the Defendant; for by ſuch pretence none can enter there but he or his Keepers. And I conceive that no body can pretend to have any profit or pleaſure in the Foreſt, which tends to the deſtruction of the Foreſt, and that is the reaſon that one cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to have Common in a Foreſt, for Sheep, Geeſe, Goats, or Hoggs, for to ſuffer them to Common there, is <hi>Ad magnum nocumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ferarum foreſtae:</hi> and ſuch a preſcription the Defendant maketh, which is not only <hi>Ad magnum nocumentum,</hi> but to the utter deſtruction of the Foreſt: And if it be objected, that this Park claimed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is but a little part of the Foreſt, this is no anſwer; for as in the Caſe of a Common, no man may preſcribe to have Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Foreſt, ſo cannot he in any part of the Foreſt, and if the Defendant may preſcribe to have ſuch an irregular Park in part of the Foreſt, ſo may others claim ſuch like preſcriptions in other parts of the Foreſt, and ſo the King ſhall loſe all the Franchiſe of his Foreſt, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may make his Fence or Ditch ſo low without-ſide, and ſo high within, that the Kings Deer cannot get out again when they are come in, and ſo this Park ſhall be in the nature of a Trap to catch the Kings Deer.</p>
               <p>And further, he that will preſcribe to have any common profit or pleaſure in the Freehold or Inheritance of another, ought to make his preſcription in ſuch manner, ſo that he muſt leave the reſidue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the Owner, and cannot utterly exclude the Owner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if one doth preſcribe to have all the Herbage, Pannage, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Land of <hi>I. S.</hi> no man can conceive that this preſcription is good. Neither can a Commoner preſcribe that the Lord of the Soile cannot put in any Cattell into the Land. But in our caſe the very Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe of the Kings Foreſt doth conſiſt of Vert, Veniſon, Lands, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Foreſt, for the King may have a Foreſt, although he hath no Land there.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Commentaries</hi> 332. If a Mannor within the Foreſt of <hi>Waltham</hi> do eſcheat to the King, and the King grants the Mannor to one in fee, yet ſhall not he have the liberty of the Foreſt. And the ſame Law is where the King grants all the Land which he hath in the Foreſt.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding I agree that one may have a Park within a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by preſcription or by grant, but then the ſame ought to be kept ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, that the Beaſts of the Foreſt cannot enter into the Park, which if not done, it is a forfeiture of the liberty of the Park, and ſo it is if he have a <hi>Salterie,</hi> or Deer-leap, for the nature of a Park is to be incloſed: and in the 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. it is ſaid, that a Park conſiſts of Soile, Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Game, and in the 15. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54307:18"/>
               <p>cloſure and game. And in the 15 <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> Lord of a Foreſt, did grant leave to one <hi>John Harrington</hi> to make a Park within the ſaid Foreſt, and there it is adjudged, that if the Grantee does ſo ſleightly incloſe the Park, ſo that the Foreſt-beaſts may get in there, that it is a forfeiture, and the Lord of the Foreſt may enter and take the Deer.</p>
               <p>But by the pretence of the Defendant, the King ſhall not have ſo much power in this Land, being in the midſt of the Foreſt, as he hath in the Lands of any of his Subjects which do lie without the Foreſt: for if Foreſt Beaſts ſtray or wander into the Land of a Subject, out of the Foreſt, the Foreſters may enter into this Land, and rechaſe them into the Foreſt again.</p>

               <p>HVsband and Wife, Tenants in Tail of the Gift of the Husband, the remainder to the Husband in fee: The Husband dyes, the Son and Heir of the Husband and Wife does levy a Fine with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, to the uſe of him and his Heirs; the Wife does let a Leaſe of the Land for 21 years, and dyes; the Son deviſeth his Land to <hi>E</hi> and his Heirs, and dyes.</p>
               <p>And, Whether this Leaſe made by the Wife were good to binde the Deviſee? was the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the Leaſe is good: For, although that by the Fine the Eſtate-tail is barred, as to the Conuſor and all his iſſues, yet does the Wife remain Tenant in Tail, as before: and therefore this Leaſe made by her is a good Eſtate, derived out of her Eſtate-tail, and ſhall binde all except the iſſues in Tail, who may claim <hi>per for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Doni:</hi> And ſo is it in the 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 51. <hi>B.</hi> Tenant in Tail, before the Statute of the 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. does make a Feoffment to the uſe of himſelf in fee, and then he and his Feoffees make a Leaſe for years, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Rent, and then is the Statute made; the Tenant in Tail dyes, and then the iſſue aliens by Fine before any entry or receit of the Rent, and holden by all the Iuſtices, except <hi>Sanders,</hi> that the Alienee ſhall not avoyd this: but otherwiſe of a Rent granted. And, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Fine had not been levyed by the iſſue, he ſhall not avoyd the Leaſe without entry; and if he had aliened after the death of his Mother, and before entry, the Alienee ſhould never avoyd the Leaſe. And in the 29 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 51. and the <hi>Comment.</hi> 557. Tenant in Tail ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a Statute-Merchant, the iſſue is attaint of Felony, and pardoned; the Tenant in Tail dyes, the iſſue enters, and the Conuſee ſues out Execution: And becauſe the iſſue was diſabled to inherit the Eſtate-tail, therefore he had it as an Occupant, and ſo it was ſubject to the Execution. And, although the remainder in Fee does paſs by way of intereſt by the Fine, yet that cannot come in poſſeſſion ſo long as any iſſue in Tail is living: and therefore if a ſtranger had entered after the death of the Wife, the Son could not have had a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the remainder, for that muſt ſuppoſe the death of the Donees in Tail without iſſue, the which cannot be in our Caſe. <hi>Comment.</hi> 560. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens</hi> Caſe. Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> Tenant in Tail of the Gift of the King, made a Leaſe for years rendering Rent, and dyed; Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſon accepts the Rent, and after was attaint of Treaſon, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, having iſſue, and adjudged that the King ſhould have the Land
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54307:19"/> in point of Reverter diſcharged of the Leaſe. But in our Caſe, the act being done by the iſſue in Tail himſelf, ſhall not enable him to make voyd the Leaſe made by his Mother, no more then if a Tenant in Tail makes a Leaſe for years, and levies a Fine with proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Donor, and dyes having iſſue, yet the Donor ſhall not avoyd the Leaſe. <hi>Vid.</hi> Lord <hi>Aberganies</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cook.</hi> 6 <hi>Rep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although that the Wife were a Ioyntreſs within the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. yet is this Leaſe clearly out of the Statute, becauſe that it is no bar or diſcontinuance to the Eſtate in Tail, as it is in Sir <hi>George Browns</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cook.</hi> 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> for this Leaſe was voydable by the iſſue, unleſs he had bar'd himſelf by his own Fine.</p>
               <p>And I conceive this Leaſe is alſo good againſt the Deviſee: for when a Tenant in Tail makes a Leaſe for years, or grants a Rent common, &amp;c. or acknowledgeth a Statute, or doth in ſome other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner charge the Land, this is a good Leaſe, Grant, or Charge to binde the Tenant in Tail, and all other, except the iſſues in Tail, and thoſe in Reverſion. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. that was made to avoyd ſuch charges, does not ayd any perſons except the iſſues in Tail, and thoſe in Remainder and Reverſion. And therefore if Tenant in Tail grant a Rent, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg a Statute, and dyes, the iſſue ſhall not be charged with it, and ſo ſhall his Feoffee; but if the Tenant in Tail himſelf, after ſuch charge, infeoffs another, and dyes, the Feoffee ſhall hold the Land charged: and if a Tenant in Tail makes a Leaſe for years, and dyes, and the iſſue doth accept the Rent, the Leaſe is made good, and is abſolute: but if he dyes ſeiſed of the Eſtate-Tail, the iſſue hath his election, either to make the Eſtate good by his acceptance of the Rent, or to avoyd the Leaſe by his entry; and if he infeoff a ſtranger before entry, the Feoffee ſhall never avoyd the Leaſe; and if the iſſue doth accept the Rent, he maketh the Leaſe good for his time: and as the Feoffee of the Tenant in Tail, and all thoſe who come to the Land by any aſſurance made be the Tenant in Tail, whereby the Eſtate in Tail is barred or diſcontinued, ſhall hold the Eſtate charged with the Leaſes and charges made by the Tenant in Tail; ſo ſhall all thoſe in like manner who come to the Land under the ſaid Tenant in Tail, although the Eſtate-tail doth remain not barred or diſcontinued (ſaving the iſſues in Tail, who are ayded by the Statute of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> the 2.) And therefore, if Tenant in Tail grants a Rent in fee, and takes a Wife, and dyes, the Wife ſhall hold charged with the Rent: and ſo if a woman Tenant in Tail grants a Rent, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and hath iſſue, and dyes, the Husband, being Tenant by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, ſhall hold the Land charged, for they are not ayded by the ſaid Statute; and ſo if Tenant in Tail grants a Rent in Fee, and makes a Leaſe for three lives, warranted by the Statute of the 32 of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. and dyes, the Leſſee ſhall hold the Land charged, <hi>Cooks Rep.</hi> 9. Count. <hi>Bedfords</hi> Caſe. And in the ſaid Caſe of the Lord <hi>Aberge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veny,</hi> it is ſaid, that the ſurviving Ioyntenant by acceptance of the Leaſe, hath deprived himſelf of the way and means of avoyding the charge; for <hi>vis accreſcendi</hi> was the onely means of avoyding it, and the right of ſurvivor is gone by the Releaſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo in our Caſe, the iſſue in Tail might have avoyded this Leaſe by his entry, but he hath quite barred himſelf by his Fine.</p>
               <p>And as to the Statute of the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. I conceive that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is prohibited by this Statute, but onely ſuch Acts as are a bar of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54307:19"/> the Eſtate-tail, or a diſcontinuance thereof; for ſo are the words of the Stature, <hi>viz. If any woman ſhall diſcontinue, alien, releaſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, with Warranty, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in Sir <hi>George Browns</hi> Caſe, in <hi>Cooks Repor. fol.</hi> 350. it is there argued, Whether a Diſcontinuance without Warranty be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Statute? but it was reſolved, that theſe words, <hi>with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi> doe refer onely to Releaſes and Confirmations, which make not diſcontinuance without Warranty: for the intention of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was not onely to prohibit every bar, but alſo every diſcontinuance: but here in this caſe there is no bar or diſcontinuance; for the woman hath made a Leaſe for years, rendering Rent, by which the Eſtate-tail is neither bound nor diſcontinued, but ſhe remains Tenant in Tail as ſhe was before, and ſo dyed ſeiſed of ſuch Eſtate; and therefore if it had not been for the Fine levyed by the iſſue in Tail himſelf, ſhe might have entered, and have avoyded the Leaſe: and this is not like the Caſe there put by <hi>Anderſon;</hi> where Feme Tenant in Tail in Ioynture within the Statute, does accept a Fine <hi>ſur conuſans de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore does grant and render the Eſtate for 1000 years; for though this be no diſcontinuance of the Eſtate-tail, yet is it a bar of the Eſtate during the time.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Hillar.</hi> 22 <hi>Jacob.</hi> I argued this Caſe again: and all the Court, <hi>viz. Doderidge, Jones,</hi> and <hi>Whitlock,</hi> did agree, That the iſſue in Tail was barred by the Fine to avoyd this Leaſe; and that although the Eſtate-tail was barred, yet is it not extinguiſhed, but remains in <hi>eſſe</hi> to ſupport the Leaſe, ſo long as any iſſue in Tail does remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; and ſo they agreed the Leaſe to be good.

               <p>In the Biſhop of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cooks</hi> 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> it is there reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that by the Statute of the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Biſhops are thereby generally reſtrained from making any eſtate or intereſt of any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, parcel of their Biſhopricks, or any charge or incumbrance out of the ſame, or of any other thing in their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54307:20"/> diſpoſition to binde their Succeſſors; except onely Leaſes for 21 years, or three lives, of ſuch Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, which have been uſually demiſed, or whereupon the uſual Rents have been reſerved, according to the ſaid Act. And, although ſuch Leaſe be made of ſuch Lands uſually demiſed, reſerving the uſual Rent according to the ſaid Statute; yet, unleſs all the limitations preſcribed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 32 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. be not purſued; as, if it be not all in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, or, that the old Leaſe be not expired or ſurrendred within one year (which is not prohibited by the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> as it was adjudged in <hi>Foxes</hi> Caſe) then ſuch Leaſe will not binde the Succeſſor, unleſs it be confirmed by the Dean and Chapter. And ſuch conſtruction as aforeſaid hath been made to diſable a Biſhop to make any Eſtate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Leaſes for 21 years, or for three lives, as is aforeſaid, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the binding of the Succeſſor, as the Grant of the next avoydance by a Biſhop to another, although it be confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, is reſtrained by the ſaid Statute of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to binde the Succeſſor, as it hath often been judged: and the reaſon is, becauſe it is ſuch an Hereditament whereon no Rent may be reſerved; for all in the Statute, that is not permitted in the <hi>Exception,</hi> is reſtrained as to the Succeſſor by the general purview of the ſaid Act: but yet ſuch Grant will binde the Biſhop himſelf, although the Statute ſays, that it ſhall be voyd againſt all intents and purpoſes: for the makers of the ſaid Act did intend, not onely the advancement of Religion, but alſo increaſe of good Hoſpitality, and avoyding dilapidations and ruine of the Church; which the Succeſſor, if the Acts of his Predeceſſor ſhould binde him, were not able to remedy; and therefore the makers of that Act did rather regard the Succeſſor. And theſe words in the Act, <hi>viz. Parcel of the poſſeſſions of his Archbiſhoprick or Biſhoprick, or united, belonging, or appertaining to the ſaid Archbiſhoprick or Biſhoprick,</hi> may be very aptly conſtrued, That the Gift of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and all other ſuch like things that are belonging to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick or Biſhoprick: for although the Biſhop cannot exerciſe this Office himſelf, yet hath he an inheritance in the gift and diſpoſing thereof: and ſo it is adjudged in <hi>Cooks</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutlands</hi> Caſe. And theſe words, <hi>Belonging to the Archbiſhoprick or Biſhoprick,</hi> ſhall be expounded for, <hi>Concerning the Archbiſhoprick or Biſhoprick.</hi> And therefore if a Writ of Annuity be brought againſt a Biſhop, upon a title of preſcription, or otherwiſe, and Iudgment be given againſt him upon Verdict or confeſſion, this is reſtrained by this Act, becauſe the Biſhop is charged with this Annuity in reſpect of his Biſhoprick; and therefore the Succeſſor ſhall be charged with the arrears incurred in the life of the Predeceſſor, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. 48 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.26. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 44. and yet is not the Annuity iſſuing out of the Biſhoprick, as appears in the 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 10. and 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 10. But becauſe this does concern the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, and does tend to the diminution of the revenues, and the impoveriſhing of the revenues, this is reſtrained by the ſaid Act of the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> And therefore to anſwer to the Objection, Wherefore ſuch an Office ſhould be granted to one ſolely? I anſwer (and it was alſo agreed to by all the Court) That if the Office be ancient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the Grant thereof, with the ancient fee, is no diminution of the Revenue, or diſpoveriſhing the Succeſſor; and therefore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſuch Grants are exempted out of the general reſtraint of the ſaid Act of <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> For, as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, <hi>Illud quod alias licitum non eſt, neceſſitas facit licitum, &amp; neceſſitas inducit privilegium quod jure
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54307:20"/> privatur.</hi> And if Biſhops have not power to grant ſuch Offices of ſervice and neceſſity for the life of the Grantees, but that their eſtates ſhall depend on incertainties, as on the death or tranſmutation of the Biſhop, then no able or ſufficient perſons will be willing to ſerve them in ſuch Offices, or at leaſt will not diſcharge their Office with any cheerfulneſs or alacrity, if they may not have ſuch eſtate in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for the term of their lives, as their Predeceſſors had: but when an ancient Office is granted to one, it is not of neceſsity to grant the ſame to two; and therefore ſuch Grant is not exempted out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reſtraint of the Statute, no more then if the Biſhop ſhould grant an Office with the ancient fee to one, and then he grants the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to another; this is reſtrained by the Statute, becauſe it is not of neceſsity: and if the Biſhop may grant ſuch Offices to two, he may grant them without any limitation of lives, and by conſequence <hi>ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum:</hi> and ſo, if he may grant a Reverſion to one, ſo he may to others alſo without any limitation: and by the ſame reaſon he may grant them in Tail or in Fee, which is quite contrary to the intention of the ſaid Act. And of ſuch opinion was <hi>Popham,</hi> Chief Iuſtice, <hi>Michaelm.</hi> 44 <hi>&amp;</hi> 45 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Stumblers</hi> Caſe, and <hi>Dyer</hi> 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 370. where <hi>Horn,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> did grant to Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> during his life a Rent out of the Mannor of <hi>Waltham, pro concilio impendendo:</hi> the Biſhop dyed, and becauſe the Rent was arrear, Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> brought an Action of Debt, for the arrears incurred in his life, againſt the Executors: In which two points are to be obſerved; 1. That the Grant was not voyd againſt the Biſhop himſelf: The other, That although the Rent was iſſuing out of the poſſeſſions, and not parcel, this was voyd by his death. And <hi>Trin.</hi> 30 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 346. in this Court: The Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> after the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> did grant to <hi>George Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> an Annuity of five marks <hi>per annum, pro concilio impenſo &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendendo,</hi> which was confirmed by the Dean and Chapter: and then the Biſhop dyed, and <hi>Boulton</hi> brought a Writ of Annuity againſt the Succeſſor, and in his Count did aver, that the Predeceſſors of the ſaid Biſhop had granted reaſonable Fees (but did not aver, that this Fee had been granted before) and did aver, that he was <hi>homo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliarius, &amp; in lege peritus;</hi> and the Opinion of the Court was againſt the Plaintiff. But there it was reſolved, that although the ſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick was founded but of late times, to wit, in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eight; yet a Grant of an Office of neceſſity to one in poſſeſſion with reaſonable fees (the reaſonableneſs whereof is to be decided by the Court of Iuſtice wherein the ſame doth depend) is good, and is reſtrained out of the general words of the ſaid Act.</p>
               <p>And in our Caſe the avowant hath averred this Office to be an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Office, and which hath been granted with a fee of five marks from time to time, by the Biſhop grantor and his Predeceſſors, to whom they pleaſed. <hi>Cooks</hi> 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsburies</hi> Caſe. The Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> was made Steward of a Mannor for life, without any words to make a Deputy; yet it was reſolved that he might make a Deputy, becauſe it was not convenient for him to exerciſe ſuch an Office: So if an Office doth deſcend to an Infant, he muſt of neceſſity make a Deputy. And ſo if a Biſhop be ſeiſed of a Mannor, he may ordain a Steward of the ſaid Mannor, and may grant to the Steward a fee for the execution of the ſaid Office, according to the reſolution in the ſaid Caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>

                  <head>The Caſe.</head>
                  <p>THe Pryor of S. <hi>Johns of Jeruſalem,</hi> did hold certain Lands diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of Tythes by reaſon of their order, <hi>Quandiu propriis manibus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colebant,</hi> the Statute of 31. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. for diſcharging of Tythes is made, the 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. it was enacted that the King ſhould have to him his Heirs and Succeſſors, all the Lands, Priviledges, and Hereditaments of the ſaid Pryory, the King dies, and the Lands by Meſne deſcents doe come to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who grants the Land to Sir <hi>Henry Weſton</hi> Grandfather to the Defendant, who died ſeiſed, and the ſame deſcended to Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> Father to the Defendant, and ſo from him to the Defendant: And, If the Land ſhould be held diſcharged of Tythes as the Pryor held it? was the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>And I conceive that the Defendant ſhall hold the land diſcharged of Tythes in the ſame manner as the Pryor held the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For the argument of which, two things are to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether the King or his Patentee ſhall have the ſame priviledge which the Pryor had by the Statute of the 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. or not?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Admitting that they ſhall not have this priviledge by generall words of this Statute, then, Whether they be diſcharged by the clauſe of the Statute of 31. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Monaſteries, or not?</p>
                  <p>And I conceive that by each of theſe Statutes, or at leaſt by one of them, the King and his Patentees ſhall hold this Land diſcharged of Tithes, <hi>Quamdiu propriis manibus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54307:21"/>
                  <p>And as to the firſt point I conceive that the Statute of the 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath ſufficient words to give this priviledge to the King, for it gives to the King not only all their Mannors, Lands, and Tenements, but alſo all their Priviledges belonging to them or to their Religion or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and this diſcharge of Tythes is a Priviledge belonging to their Religion or Order; for whereas Pope <hi>Paſcall</hi> did order that no Monk or religious Order ſhould pay Tithes, afterwards Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> did grant this priviledge, <hi>Solis Hieroſolimariis &amp; Hoſpitulariis, Ciſterſienſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; Templaribus,</hi> and did take away that priviledge from all other Orders: And I conceive it will not be denied, but that the Pryor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath this priviledge, and if he had it, then it will follow that the King and his Patentee hath it alſo, for all their priviledges are given to the King.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> that theſe priviledges are given in reſpect only of their Order, and the Order bring gone, the priviledge is gone alſo.</p>
                  <p>I do agree that all perſonall priviledges concerning their Order are gone by reaſon of their diſſolution,<note place="margin">Reſponſ.</note> but ſuch priviledges as concern the Land, and will make the Land moſt profitable to the King are remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and are given to the King for the intent of the Statute was to give it to the King in as ample and beneficiall manner, and with all ſuch priviledges concerning the Land, as they themſelves had. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Tythes are not iſſuing out of the Land, nor ſhall be extended for unity of poſſeſſion of the land (as in the 42. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.13. Where a Pryor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tythes did purchaſe the Land and made a Feoffment, yet ſhall he have the Tythes, and ſo if a Parſon makes a Leaſe for yeares of his Glebe-land, yet he ſhall have Tythes thereof) yet the priviledge to hold the Land diſcharged of Tythes is a priviledge concerning the land, and is not like to the caſe of the appropriation of a Rectory to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars which was diſappropriate by the diſſolution of their Order, for the reaſon there is, becauſe the appropriation was made to a body corporate, which body being diſſolved, it is impoſſible they ſhould retain the ſame, and no body elſe can have it without a new appropriation or an Act of Parliament: and for Appropriations to Abbeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the clauſe in the 31. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was neceſſary, for otherwiſe the Patentees of the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lay-people, and not capable of an Appropriation, they cannot have it but by ſpeciall proviſion by Act of Parliament, but any man may hold Land diſcharged of Tythes.</p>
                  <p>But it may be again objected, that in the ſame Parliament an Act was made to revive temporall Liberties, Priviledges, and Franchiſes <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> of Monaſteries; and therefore all thoſe had been loſt if it had not been for this Statute, and Sprituall priviledges are not revived by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and therefore they are gone.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of making of this Act was, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                     </label> becauſe divers priviledges which they had, as <hi>Bona &amp; Catalla Fellonum, &amp;c.</hi> were extinct by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown, and therefore it was neceſſary to revive them, but if the Statute had not been made yet ſhall the King have all thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which were not extinct, as Parks, Chaſes, Warrens, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Fairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this priviledge is given to the King may be proved by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo in the Statute, whereby it is provided, that all priviledges of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries before uſed or claimed in houſes, or other places commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led S. <hi>Johns Hold,</hi> and all other Sanctuaries before uſed and appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid Hoſpitall ſhall be void and of none effect, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54307:22"/> that if that <hi>Proviſo</hi> had not been made the priviledge of Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had been in the King and his Patentees, in the ſame Mannor as had been uſed before the diſſolution, and that by force of this word <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and yet this priviledge of Sanctuary does not concern the Land as diſcharge of payment of Tythes doth.</p>

                     </label> I anſwer that there were two reaſons to put this Clauſe into the ſaid Statute. 1. To induce purchaſers to buy the ſaid Land, and at a greater price. 2.

Biſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Caſe; but in our Caſe the means is very well known, and therefore ſuch clauſe was not neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſecond point, I conceive that the clauſe for diſcharge of the payment of Tythes doth extend to the poſſeſſion of this Pryory, and yet I do agree that their Lands are given to the King not by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 31. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. but by the 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. And to prove this, the Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. does extend to all Abbies, Pryories, Hoſpitalls, and other Religious and Eccleſiaſticall houſes, and this Pryory was Religions and Eccleſiaſticall, for they vowed Obedience and Chaſtity; and the caſe in the 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 16. in the caſe of <hi>Martin Dockwray,</hi> where it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that Fryers are dead perſons in the Law, be they of an Abby or any other Pryory, and that appeares by the Statute of 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. of their diſſolution, by which it is enacted that the Fryers ſhall ſue and be ſued by their proper names, and that they ſhall have ſuch capacities, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and freedomes as were given to other Religious perſons in an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And it is not inconvenient that the King and his Patentees ſhould have the benefit of the clauſe of the Statute of 31. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. in thoſe lands given to the King by the Statute of the 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. as the Statute of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton Burnell</hi> does provide, that if the Extender upon a Statute Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant does extend the Lands too high, they ſhall anſwer this to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſee, and the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. does order a new form of Recognizance to be taken before any of the cheif Iuſtices, yet the Conuſee ſhall have the ſaid benefit of the Statute of <hi>Acton Burnell,</hi> although it was made two hundred years before the other Statute.

               <p>Vpon hearing and debating of the matter, as well on the fifteenth as the eighteenth of <hi>June</hi> laſt, the Court being aſſiſted with Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> upon the Plaintiffs Bill of Review for the reviving and reverſall of a Decree made in a Cauſe wherein the ſaid <hi>Richard Mountford</hi> deceaſed, Executor of <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> was Plaintiff againſt the now Plaintiff, and <hi>Thomas Foſter</hi> Eſquire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſumme of one thouſand ſeven hundred pounds, raiſed out of the Rents and Profits of certain Lands and Tenements in <hi>Linſted, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingley,</hi> and <hi>Worth</hi> in the County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> in truſt for the ſaid <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> during his Minority, and which the now Plaintiff by the Decree of this Court was to pay in caſe the ſaid <hi>Foſter</hi> ſhould fail to pay the ſame: ſeverall matters were offered by the Plaintiffs Councell for the reverſall of the ſaid Decree, as namely, that the now Plaintiff was decreed to pay the ſumme of one thouſand ſeven hundred pounds as rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the profits of the Infants Lands ſettled upon an account made up by the ſaid <hi>Forſter,</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> the Infant, after he came to age, whereto the Plaintiff <hi>Townley</hi> was neither party nor privy, nor ever conſented nor ought to be bound thereby. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſaid Plaintiff is by the ſaid Decree made lyable to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the profits raiſed out of the ſaid Infants Eſtate, whereas he never received any profits at all, and although he gave ſome Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, yet the ſame were onely for the three firſt half yeares, and no more, and were but to ballance an account, the monies disburſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to as much as the Receipts, and there being three other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtees with him, the Plaintiffs Councell conceived that he ought not to be charged with more then he himſelf received, eſpecially for that the other parties truſted, and who received the profits were, or were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be, men of ability, and reſponſible. Touching which laſt point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that where on the Plaintiffs Councell chiefly inſiſted for the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of the ſaid Decree as againſt the now Plaintiff; It appeared unto this Court, that <hi>Challoner</hi> Father of <hi>Thomas</hi> the Infant, did heretofore make a Leaſe of the ſaid Lands to one <hi>Weeks</hi> for five and thirty yeares, and afterwards conveyed away the Reverſion to <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> his Brother, and after the death of <hi>Francis</hi> (according to an Award made between the ſaid <hi>Weeks</hi> and <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> the Brother, who was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54307:23"/> Vncle to <hi>Thomas</hi> the Infant) the Leaſe of five and thirty years, and the Reverſion in Fee-ſimple were to be aſſigned to parties truſted by the ſaid <hi>Weeks,</hi> and one <hi>Barbara Challoner,</hi> Mother of the ſaid Infant, and by the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the Vncle, the Leaſe to be intruſt for <hi>Weeks</hi> for life, the remainder to <hi>Barbara</hi> for life, the remainder to <hi>Thomas</hi> the Infant, and the reverſion in fee to be in truſt for the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the Infant. But upon the limitation or Condition that the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the Infant when he came of age ſhould make ſome aſſurance to <hi>Thomas</hi> the Vncle according to the Award, wherein if he failed, then the truſt limited to him ſhould ceaſe, and the Truſtees ſhould be ſeiſed for <hi>Thomas</hi> the Vncle. In purſuance whereof the now Plaintiff and the ſaid <hi>Forſter</hi> were truſted together with one <hi>Langworth</hi> and <hi>Lovell</hi> to take the Eſtate in the Leaſe, and did take an Aſſignment thereof from <hi>Weeks</hi> the 12th. of <hi>June,</hi> 9. <hi>Jacobi:</hi> And all the Truſtees ſealed the Counterpart, and the ſame day the now Plaintiff and <hi>Forſter</hi> aſſigned their moyity in the ſaid Leaſe to one Mr. <hi>Peacock</hi> and <hi>Robert Forſter,</hi> who were not privy nor acquainted therewith, and on the thirteenth of <hi>June,</hi> the ninth of King <hi>James,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> the Vncle paſſed over the Inheritance to the now Plaintiff and <hi>Thomas Forſter,</hi> whereby it was probable that the ſaid Aſſignment made by the now Plaintiff and <hi>Thomas Forſter,</hi> of their intereſt in the moyity of the Leaſe, was to keep the ſame from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extinguiſhed. After which aſſurance ſo made, <hi>Weeks,</hi> during his life, and <hi>Barbara</hi> after him during her life received the profits of the ſaid Lands, and <hi>Barbara</hi> in the year of our Lord 1614. dyed. And it appeared that ſoon after the death of the ſaid <hi>Barbara, viz.</hi> 23. of <hi>March,</hi> 12. <hi>Jacobi, Langworth</hi> one of the Truſtees of the Leaſe being dead, whereby his intereſt in the moyety ſurvived in <hi>Lovell,</hi> that <hi>Thomas Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner</hi> the Vncle procured the ſaid <hi>Lovell</hi> to aſſign over his intereſt in the ſaid Leaſe, to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> the Vncle, lyable to the ſaid truſt, as by a Copy of the Aſſignment now read appeared. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the confeſſion of the now Plaintiff, and by his anſwer to the former Bill, and by the Acquittances now produced that the now Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff joyned with the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> in giving acquittances for the three firſt half years Rents, but it did not appear that he ever received any after, or gave any more Acquittances, but it doth appeare by the proofs, that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> the Vncle, who had the Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Lovell,</hi> did receive the Rents of the Tenants, and payd the ſame over to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter,</hi> and that when the Infant came of age, he called the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> the Vncle to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that they did account: And that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> did then deliver him a Book of account, which the Defendant now produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Court, by which it did appear, that for the three firſt half years the Rents were received by the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the Vncle, and by him paid to the now Plaintiff, and the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> for the uſe of the Infant, but for all the ſubſequent time the ſame were received by the ſaid <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> the Vncle, and by him paid to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> alone, who (as was not now denyed) was at the time of ſuch receits generally taken to be of great ability and reſponſable, as it alſo appeared by the proofs, that the ſaid Infant after he came of age, had declared the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> to be his Debtor, and did by his Will read in Court, give the ſaid ſumme of one thouſand ſeven hundred pounds to the ſaid <hi>Mountford</hi> as a Debt owing by the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not mentioning the now Plaintiff. Vpon all which this Court was fully ſatisfied, that the now Plaintiff received no penny of profits
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54307:23"/> after the three firſt half years: but whether he ought to be charged with all that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſter</hi> received, being a Co-truſtee with him, in reſpect the ſaid <hi>Forſter</hi> is now declined in his Eſtate (as is conceived) this Court ſomewhat doubted: and although a preſident was produced, wherein this Court had charged parties truſted but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to their ſeveral and reſpective receits, and not one for the other; yet in reſpect the Defendants Councel oppoſed the ſame, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many preſidents to be on the other ſide, and the Lord Keeper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the caſe to be of great conſequence, and thought not fit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſame ſuddenly, but to adviſe thereof, and deſired the Lords the Iudges aſſiſtance to take the ſame into their ſerious conſiderations, and to aſſiſt him with their advice therein, whereby ſome courſe might be ſettled that parties truſted might not be too much puniſhed, leſt it ſhould diſhearten men to take any truſt, which would be inconvenient on the one ſide; nor that too much liberty ſhould be given to parties truſted, leſt they ſhould be emboldened to break the truſt impoſed on them, and ſo be as much prejudicial on the other ſide. And the Lord Keeper, and the Lords the Iudges aſſiſtants afterwards conferring together, and upon mature deliberation concerning the caſe, to be of great importance, his Lordſhip was pleaſed to call unto him alſo Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Crook,</hi> Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Barcley,</hi> and Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Crawley,</hi> for their aſſiſtance alſo in the ſame; and appointed preſidents to be looked over, as well in this, as in other Courts, if any could be found touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point in queſtion; whereupon ſeveral preſidents were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before them, ſome in this Court, and ſome in the Court of Wards, where parties truſted were chargeable onely according to their ſeveral and reſpective receits, and not one to anſwer for the other; but no preſident on the contrary was produced to them. Whereupon his Lordſhip, after long and mature deliberation on the caſe, and ſerious advice with all the ſaid Iudges, did this day in open Court declare the reſolution of his Lordſhip and the ſaid Iudges: That where Lands or Leaſes were conveyed to two or more upon truſt, and one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all or the moſt part of the profits, and after dyeth or decayeth in his Eſtate, his Co-truſtees ſhall not be charged, or be compelled in this Court, to anſwer for the receits of him ſo dying or decayed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome purchaſe, fraud or evil dealing appear to have been in them to prejudice their truſt; for they being by Law Ioyntenants or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in common, every one by Law may receive either all or as much of the profits as he can come by: And it being the caſe of moſt men in theſe days, that their perſonal Eſtates do not ſuffice to pay their debts, prefer their children, and perform their Wills, they are enforced to truſt their friends with ſome part of their real Eſtate, to make up the ſame, either by the ſale, or perception of profits: and if ſuch of theſe friends, who carry themſelves without fraud, ſhould be chargeable out of their own Eſtates for the faults and deficiencies of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtees, who were not nominated by them, few men would undertake any ſuch truſt. And if two Executors be, and one of them waſte all, or any part of the Eſtate, the <hi>Devaſtavit</hi> ſhall by Law charge him onely, and not his Co-executor: and in that caſe, <hi>Equitas ſequitur Legem,</hi> there having been many preſidents reſolved in this Court, that one Executor ſhall not anſwer nor be charged for the act or default of his companion. And it is no breach of truſt, to permit one of the truſtees to receive all or the moſt part of the profits, it falling out many times that ſome of the Truſtees live far from the Lands, and are put in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54307:24"/> truſt out of other reſpects then to be troubled with the receit of the profits. But his Lordſhip and the ſaid Iudges were of opinion, that if two Truſtees were, and one of them without warrant of the party that truſteth him, or of a Court of Equity, aſſigneth his Eſtate, and the Aſſignee doth receive the profits, and becometh non-ſolvent, he that made the Aſſignment ſhall anſwer it for him, but the other original Truſtee ſhall anſwer for no more then what he receiveth himſelf, becauſe the Aſſign cometh not in by him, or his aſſent or appointment: and that in caſe, if the original Truſtee, that did not make the Aſſignment, receive the whole profits, and become non-ſolvent, neither the Aſſignor nor the Aſſignee ſhall be anſwerable for them: and if an Obligation be made to two in truſt, and one of them releaſe the whole debt, as by law he may, this ſhall not charge his companion for any part: and albeit in all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption this caſe hath often happened; yet no preſident hath been produced to his Lordſhip or the Iudges, that in any ſuch Caſe the Co-truſtee hath been charged for the act or fault of his companion: and therefore it is to be preſumed, that the current and clear opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath gone, that he is not to be charged (it having not till of late been brought in queſtion) in a caſe that by all likelyhood hath frequently happened. But his Lordſhip and the ſaid Iudges did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that if upon the proofs or circumſtances the Court be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that there be <hi>Dolus malus,</hi> or any evil practice, fraud or ill intent in him that permitted his companion to receive the whole profits, he may be charged though he received nothing. And his Lordſhip and the ſaid Iudges did declare, that in this particular Caſe, they did not finde any material proof againſt Mr. <hi>Townley,</hi> to make his caſe worſe then the general caſe aforeſaid, but rather better (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onely for the three half years Rent, which he joyned in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance with Mr. <hi>Forſter;</hi> for the receit of the profits alone by Mr. <hi>Forſter</hi> is no breach of truſt in Mr. <hi>Townley:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner,</hi> when he came of full age, took Mr. <hi>Forſter</hi> for his Debtor. <hi>And therefore it is ordered and decreed,</hi> That ſo much of the ſaid Decree as chargeth Mr. <hi>Townley</hi> with any more of the profits then the three half years, for which he joyned in acquittance, ſhall be reverſed: but as for thoſe three half years profits, if the ſame were not disburſed or imployed for the uſe of Mr. <hi>Challoner,</hi> then for ſo much thereof as hath not been ſo disburſed or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſaid Complainant Mr. <hi>Townley</hi> ought to be anſwerable, and the Defendant may call the Plaintiff before Mr. <hi>Page,</hi> one of the Maſters of this Court, to audite the account touching theſe three half years, if any difference be thereabouts. And laſtly, it is ordered, that the Recognizances given on the Plaintiffs part, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Order of this Court, be diſcharged.</p>

               <p>So in our Caſe, the Plaintiff ought firſt to require the Defendant to make the Leaſe, and this of neceſſity ought to be done where he can finde the Defendant, for it is impoſſible to do it on the Land, unleſs the Defendant be there, and the Plaintiff cannot compel him to be there: But when the Plaintiff hath made his requeſt, the next action is then to be done by the Defendant; and therefore he ought to go to the Land, and to be ready there to make the Leaſe.

A.</hi> is bound to <hi>B.</hi> on condition that <hi>C.</hi> ſhall infeoff <hi>B.</hi> by ſuch a day, and did ſhew that <hi>C.</hi> was there ready on the Land, and <hi>B</hi> was not there to receive the Feoffment: and there it was argued, whether the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54307:25"/> iſſue ſhould be, upon the being of <hi>C.</hi> upon the Land who ought to make the Leaſe, or of <hi>B.</hi> who was to take the Leaſe; and <hi>in fine</hi> it was adjudged, that the iſſue ſhould be, whether <hi>C.</hi> were there or not? for he ought to be there, or elſe the Bond was forfeit. So that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant upon requeſt ought to go to the Land, and there to attend a convenient time to make the Eſtate; and then if the perſons named do not come thither, he is excuſed; but when he goes not to the Land, but does utterly refuſe to make the Eſtate, it is to no purpoſe for the Aſſigns to come to the Land: and admitting the Law would enforce them to attend there, then I demand how long they ought to attend? for in all places where the attendance of one is required in a place cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the Law, the time of his attendance is limited, <hi>18</hi> and <hi>19 Eliz. Dyer 354.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Objection is, that the Article for making of the Leaſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> is to make a Leaſe of the ſaid Mannor, whereas no Mannor is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before; and the requeſt is, to make a Leaſe of the houſes and of the Land, late in the Tenure of <hi>Randolph Sowdley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That the Demiſe in the firſt Article, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> is of the Mannor-houſe and all the Lands, which were in the Tenure of <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph Sowdley,</hi> with all the appurtenances thereto belonging; then when he agrees to make a Leaſe of the ſaid Mannor, it ſhall be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mannor mentioned before: and although it be not in verity a Mannor, yet in reputation it may be a Mannor, and that is enough to make it to be put in the agreement. <hi>22 H. 6. 39. a.</hi> where one pleaded a Feoffment of eight Acres of Land by the name of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and adjudged by the Court to be a good Feoffment, although the acres were not ſet forth: and in the <hi>27</hi> of <hi>H. 6. 2.</hi> a Plough-land may paſs by the name of a Mannor.</p>
               <p>The requeſt is made too late, for the time limited to enter is the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>Anunciation, 1612.</hi> and the requeſt is not until the ninth of <hi>June</hi> next after, and that is too late; for the Leſſor ought to have 20 <hi>l.</hi> fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the entry and making of the Leaſe, and therefore the requeſt ought to be made at the time that the entry was to be made: and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Andrews</hi> Caſe, and the Lord <hi>Cromwels</hi> Caſe in L. <hi>Cooks Rep.</hi> were cited. To which Objection <hi>Cook</hi> and all the Court did ſeem to incline.</p>
               <p>But I conceive that the requeſt is made in good time enough, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The Eſtate here is to be made by the Defendant; and although he be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not bound to do it without requeſt, yet may he do it, or at leaſt he may offer to do it, without any requeſt: and therefore if there be any loſs in the not doing of it, it is his own fault, becauſe he did not offer to make the Eſtate, and is not the Plaintiffs fault; and if he had offered to make the Eſtate, and the Plaintiff had refuſed, he had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
               <p>And therefore the rule is given in the Lord <hi>Cromwels</hi> Caſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, that when a woman or a Grantee upon condition is to make an Eſtate to the Grantor, and no time is limited, he hath time for his life, unleſs the party who is to have the Eſtate do haſten it by requeſt: but if an advowſon be granted on ſuch condition, the Regrant ought to to be before the Church becomes voyd: ſo, if the condition be to grant Rent payable at certain days, the Grant ought to be before any day of payment; for otherwiſe he ſhall loſe the Preſentation, and the Rent which will incur before the Grant made. And in the <hi>14 Ed. 3. Debt.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54307:26"/> 138.</hi> In a Debt upon a Bond, the Defendant pleaded the Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he granted twelve marks Rent, the Bond ſhould be voyd, and demanded Iudgment, &amp;c. becauſe no time was limited, ſo that he might do it when he would; and ſaid, that he was always ready to grant the twelve marks Rent: and becauſe he demurred not, iſſue was joyned, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If this not making requeſt ſhall be any damage to the Plaintiff, it muſt be becauſe the Defendant ſuffers loſs by it, as in the caſes above cited; but in this caſe the Defendant hath the ſame remedy for the <hi>20 l.</hi> although no Eſtate be made, as he ſhould have had if the Eſtate had been made; for by the fourth Article it is agreed, that if there be no Eſtate made of the Land, the Plaintiff ſhall enter at the <hi>Anunciation, 1612.</hi> And I conceive that this payment ought to be made at the time limited for the entry; for it is a mutual agreement that doth binde both parties: and therefore it lies not in the power of the Plaintiff, for his want of entry, to defeat the Defendant of his <hi>20 l.</hi> agreed to be payd to him: but when he enters, it ſhall be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he entered when it was agreed he ſhould enter, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Anunciation, 1612.</hi> And if he payd it not then, the Defendant might have had his Action of Covenant, whether any Leaſe were made or not. And in Sir <hi>Andrew Corbets</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cook. Rep. 4. 81.</hi> certain Land is deviſed to <hi>A.

               <p>A man and a woman are Ioynt-tenants for life, the woman marries,<note place="margin">The Caſe.</note> the Husband and Wife by Indenture do let their moyety for years, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Rent, and after the woman dies.</p>
               <p>And the queſtion was, whether the ſurviving Ioynt-tenant could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this Leaſe.</p>
               <p>And I conceive he cannot.</p>
               <p>And for the Argument of this Caſe, I ſhall obſerve theſe two things thereof.</p>
               <p>That if the woman who made this Leaſe had been ſole at the time of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the making, this Leaſe had been good during her life, and the life of her Companion the other Ioynt-tenant.</p>
               <p>That this Leaſe being made by the Husband and Wife, is not void, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> but voidable.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt Point, <hi>Littleton fol.</hi> 63. and 64. ſaies, that if two <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>1</label> Ioynt-tenants in Fee be, and one grants a Rent-charge and dies, the Survivor ſhall hold the Land diſcharged; but if one makes a Leaſe for years and dies, the Leaſe is good againſt the Survivor: and in <hi>Hales</hi> Caſe in the <hi>Comment,</hi> If two Ioynt-tenants be for years, and one of them does grant to <hi>I.S.</hi> that if he payes twenty pounds at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> he ſhall have his moyety, and the Grantor dies, and <hi>I. S.</hi> does pay the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet ſhall not he have the Land, becauſe the Condition precedes the Eſtate, but if he make a Leaſe for yeares to commence at a day to come, and dies before the day, yet is the Leaſe good againſt the Survivor: and ſo in <hi>Trin.</hi> 37. <hi>Eli. Harbury</hi> and <hi>Bartons</hi> Caſe. Two Ioynt-tenants are for life, and one lets his moyety for years to commence after his death, and dies, and agreed to be a good Leaſe againſt the Survivor: for as <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſaith, every Ioynt-tenant is ſeiſed <hi>Per my &amp; per tout,</hi> and hath an Eſtate in one moyety not only for his own life, or his own time, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the time and life of his Companion, and therefore every Eſtate made by him is good for a moyety ſo long as the Eſtate of himſelf and his Companion continues, but a Rent-charge ſhall not bind his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, becauſe he claimes by the firſt Conveyance which is above his Companions Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And as to the ſecond point, it is cleer that when Husband and Wife <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>2</label> make a Feoffment in Fee, or a Leaſe for years of the Land of the Wife rendring Rent, the Wife after the death of her Husband may accept the Rent, and make the Leaſe good; as in 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2. the caſe of the Feoffment is agreed, and if a Woman after the death of her Husband does accept the Rent, ſhe ſhall be barred in a <hi>Cui in vita,</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 13. 15. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 17. and <hi>Dyer</hi> 91. <hi>B.</hi> Husband and Wife make a Leaſe for years
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54307:27"/> by Indenture, and the Husband dies, and ſhe accepts the Rent, ſhe ſhall be bound thereby and ſhall not avoid the Leaſe.</p>
               <p>Vpon which two things being (as I conceive) unqueſtionable, it follows that this Leaſe at the time of the making thereof, is not void but voidable. And therefore the ſole queſtion will be, how this Leaſe is voidable, and if it may be avoided by the ſurviving Ioynt-tenant, or not?</p>
               <p>And I conceive that it is avoidable by the Wife only, if ſhe ſurvive her Husband, and not by the other Ioynt-tenant, and that for two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Survivor comes in above the Leaſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot take advantage of any imperfection or defect to avoid the Leaſe, 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>B.</hi> If a Feoffment or a Leaſe for life be made to two, and one dies, the other may plead the Eſtate to be made to him only, for he is not in by him that is dead, but by the Feoffor or Leſſor,: and <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> 187. <hi>a.</hi> Two Ioynt-tenants for life, one makes a Leaſe for yeares rendring Rent, and dies, the Survivor ſhall not have the Rent. And if Tenant for life makes a Leaſe for years rendring Rent, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Leſſor, the Leſſor ſhall not have the Rent, for he is in by his Reverſion which is above the Leaſe for years: and 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 96. <hi>a.</hi> An Executor had Iudgment to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cover a Debt, and died inteſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Adminiſtration is committed to another, he ſhall not have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon this Iudgment, becauſe that he being Adminiſtrator imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Teſtator is above the recovery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no privity between the ſurviving Ioynt-tenant and the Leſſor, to make him avoid the Leaſe which is voidable, as in 8. <hi>Rep. Whittinghams</hi> caſe, Privies in blood, as Heir generall or ſpeciall ſhall avoid a voidable eſtate made by the Anceſtor, as if an Infant make a Feoffment in Fee, his Heir may well enter and avoid the Feoffment: but Privies in Law, as Lord by eſcheat, Lord of a Villain, or Lord who enters for Mortmain, ſhall never take benefit of the Infancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are but ſtrangers. And therefore if an Infant make a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Fee, and dies without Heir, the Feoffment is unavoidable, 49. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 13. 6. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 3 7. <hi>H.</hi> 5. 9. 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 42. And as to Privies in Eſtate, as Ioynt-tenants, Husband and Wife, Donor, in Tail, and Donee, Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Leſſee, it is there alſo reſolved, that they ſhall not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Infancy, unle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e it be in ſome ſpeciall caſes. And therefore if Tenant in Tail within age makes a Feoffment in Fee, and dies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, the Donor ſhall not enter, contrary to the opinion of <hi>Rick</hi> and <hi>Frisby,</hi> 6. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. becauſe that here is only a Privity in Eſtate between them, and no right does accrue to the Donor by the death of the Donee: So if two Ioynt-tenants in Fee be, and one of them being within age makes a Feoffment in Fee, and dies, the Survivor ſhall not enter; but if two Ioynt-tenants within age do make a Feoffment, one joynt Right remains in them, and therefore if one dies, the Right will ſurvive, and the Survivor may enter in all, and the ſame Law of Covertue, or <hi>non ſanae memoriae,</hi> as it is ſaid alſo in <hi>Whittinghams</hi> caſe: and in <hi>Fitzherb. N. B.</hi> 192. <hi>K.</hi> If two Ioynt-tenants within age do alien in Fee, they muſt ſue ſeverall Writs of <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> becauſe that the cauſe of their Action is their nonage, which is ſeverall, for the nonage of the one is not the nonage of the other. But if Husband and Wife within age, do make a Feoffment of the Wifes land, and the Husband dye, the Wife ſhall have a <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Dum fuit infra ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> 6. and 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>B. Kelloway:</hi> In a <hi>Formedon</hi> by the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> if an Infant does make a Feoffment,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54307:27"/> none ſhall avoid this but the Infant himſelf and his Heirs, and no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the ſame Law of a Feme Covert.</p>
               <p>And as to the caſe of <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> 33. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cited in the Lord <hi>Cromwells</hi> caſe, Where the Husband made a Leaſe of his Wifes Land for years, and then he and his Wife aliened by Fine, and the Husband dies, the Conuſee ſhall avoid this Leaſe, which I agree to: for the Leaſe being made by the Husband only, is utterly void againſt the Wife, and cannot be made good by any Act done by the Wife, and the Land paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all from the woman by the Fine, and therefore the Leaſe cannot bind the Conuſee.</p>
               <p>The Survivor in one caſe cannot make the Leaſe good by the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Rent, becauſe that the Rent does not belong unto him, and therefore he ſhall not be received to avoid this Leaſe, as in <hi>Nat. B.</hi> 138. <hi>B.</hi> the Heir ſhall not have a <hi>Ceſſavit</hi> for ceaſing in the time of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, for he ſhall not have the Rent or the arrearages incurred in the life of his Anceſtors, and the reaſon is as I conceive, becauſe that the Law does give this benefit to the Tenant for the ſaving of his Tenancy for the tender of arrearages, the which cannot be to the Lord, becauſe that the Rent is not due to him, and therefore the Lord ſhall loſe his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather then the Tenant ſhall be deprived of his advantage of ſaving the land by his tender: And by this caſe alſo, the Aunt and the Neice ſhall not joyne in a <hi>Ceſſavit,</hi> for a ceaſing made before the Title of the Neice accrued, but in <hi>Nat. F.B.</hi> 139. it is otherwiſe there of joynt-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as I conceive, the reaſon whereof is, becauſe, as I conceive, the Survivor ſhall have all the Rent, and therefore the tender may be made to him, 13. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>B.</hi> If one makes a Feoffment in Fee rendring Rent upon condition to re-enter for non-payment, and dies, the Rent being arrear, the Heir cannot demand the Rent or enter for non-payment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Rent is not due to him, and as he cannot diſpence with the Condition for acceptance of the Rent, ſo cannot he enter for non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
               <p>And I argued this Caſe again on Fryday, being the firſt day of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> Term, 14. <hi>Jac.</hi> 31. <hi>Maii,</hi> at which day, <hi>Daſton</hi> did alſo argue for the Defendant, but the Court did not then give any direct Opinion, but ſeemed to incline very much for the Plaintiff.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54307:30"/> Rules of the Common-law: for although he that comes in by ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ought to be admitted by the Lord, yet all the Eſtate paſſeth from the Copyholder who ſurrenders, and the Lord is but an inſtrument to make the admittance, and he gives not the Eſtate; and therefore it follows, that the Eſtate is given by the Copyholder himſelf. <hi>Cooks Rep.</hi> 4. <hi>Charls Pennifathers</hi> Caſe, That Copyholders derive not their Eſtates from the Eſtate of the Lord, and therefore if a Diſſeiſor or Tenant at ſufferance do make an admittance upon a ſurrender, or upon a deſcent, this ſhall binde the Diſſeiſee: and if Tenant for years of a Mannor, or a Tenant at will, does make a voluntary Grant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom, this ſhall binde him in the Reverſion: and the ſame Law of a Feoffee upon Condition. <hi>Dyer</hi> 342. And ſo if there be Lord of a Mannor wherein are Copyholds for life, and the Lord mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and grants Copies, the Wife ſhall not avoyd this. 9 <hi>Rep. Swans</hi> Caſe, and 4 <hi>Rep. Taverners</hi> Caſe: The Lord is but an inſtrument to make admittance, and he that is admitted ſhall not be ſubject to the charge of the Lord. And 4 <hi>Rep. Buntings</hi> Caſe, who ſurrendered out of Court, and dyed before the ſurrender was preſented; yet it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and adjudged, that the ſurrender was good, and that it may be preſented after his death: but if it be not preſented according to the cuſtom, then it becomes voyd. And ſo in <hi>Kite</hi> and <hi>Queintons</hi> Caſe: If he to whom the ſurrender was made dyes before the admittance, yet his Heirs ſhall be admitted. And <hi>Periams</hi> Caſe: The Feoffment is not good, unleſs it be preſented in Court according to the cuſtom: yet if the Feoffor or Feoffee dye, and after it is preſented, this is good, as in caſe of a Deed delivered as an Eſcroul upon condition</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that the two Tenants to whom the ſurrender was <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> made, are dead alſo.</p>
               <p>But this will not avoyd it: for nothing at all does paſs from them, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> for they are but only witneſſes of the ſurrender, and therefore it may as well be preſented after their deaths, as in their life-time: as in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. If a Iuſtice takes a note of a fine, although he dyes before it be certified, yet may it be certified by his Executors, and the Fine ſhall be good: and it is alſo reſolved in <hi>Buntings</hi> Caſe, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir death ſhall not hurt the ſurrender, but upon good proof it may be ſurrendered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deaths: as in 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. If a Feme ſole does make an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and delivers it as an Eſcroul to a ſtranger to be delivered upon condition, and ſhe marries or dyes, and then the Condition is performed, and the Bond delivered, it is a good Bond: and ſo it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in <hi>Brags</hi> Caſe, and <hi>Butlers</hi> Caſe alſo: and it is not like to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment with warranty of Attorney to make Livery, or the Grant of a Reverſion, and the Feoffor dyes, or takes husband before Livery or Attornment; for there nothing paſſeth until the Livery or Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to <hi>Littleton:</hi> and the Feoffee, if he enter, is but Tenant at will, and it lies in the power of the Grantor to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, but ſo cannot he that makes a ſurrender out of Court.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>Perimans</hi> Caſe was here objected, That if the Tenant would not preſent the Feoffment, the Feoffee ſhould have his Action on the Caſe; and the ſame Law, if the Lord will not hold his Court within the time: but there is no ſuch matter in the Book. But in our Caſe, no Action can be againſt the two Tenants, to whom the ſurrender was made, having done no wrong, for they can make no preſentment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Court be held: neither can any Action be brought againſt the Lord, for the not holding his Court, becauſe he is not limited to a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54307:31"/> certain time to hold his Court; neither does the cuſtom refer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment to any time, but onely to the next Court: and admitting he may have an Action on the Caſe, yet is not that any reaſon that he ſhould loſe his cuſtomary Inheritance, and be contented onely with a perſonal Action, wherein he ſhall onely receive damages; and it may be alſo, that the party is inſufficient, or may dye, whereby the Action will become fruitleſs. And it ſhall be a very great inconvenience, if the not keeping of a Court by the Lord ſhall hinder the ſurrender, when no time is limited when the ſurrender ſhall be, but onely at the next Court: for then thoſe who argue againſt this ſurrender, ought to limit another time then the cuſtom doth limit to make this preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and what time will he limit? peradventure he that made the ſurrender will ſay, that the next Court ought to be holden the next day, or within a month; but this lies not in his power: for when the Cuſtom, which is the very being and life of a Copyholder, hath limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next Court, no man can ſhorten that time, and the length of time cannot be material, and no time is material until the time be paſt that is limited by the Cuſtom. And although it hath been ſaid, that Cuſtoms ſhall be taken ſtrictly, yet not ſo ſtrictly, but they ſhall have a reaſonable time of expoſition according to the reaſon of the Common-Law: as in the 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Lerchfords</hi> Caſe, where the cuſtom was, that if the Heir of the Copyholder did not come to any of the three Courts upon proclamation, to claim his Copy, it ſhould be forfeit: And <hi>Thomas Copley</hi> did dye the 27 of <hi>Elizabeth, William</hi> his ſon being then beyond the Seas, and the three Courts were holden, and the proclamations made, and he came not into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> until the firſt of King <hi>James.</hi> But in our caſe, we are within the Cuſtom: and although the ſurrender here is not perfect, until the preſentment made in Court; yet the Plaintiff, being Heir to him who made the ſurrender, is bound as his Anceſtor was; for he cannot countermand or avoyd the ſurrender, and therefore his entry was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal. And therefore Iudgment ought to be given againſt the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>And upon the Argument of this Caſe, <hi>Michaelm.</hi> 14 <hi>Jacob. Crook, Doderidge,</hi> and <hi>Haughton,</hi> did agree, that the Eſtate did remain in him who made the ſurrender, until he to whoſe uſe the ſurrender was made be admitted by the Lord: and this they agreed the Lord might do out of Court: and <hi>Haughton</hi> ſaid, that the acceptance of the Rent by the Lord, that was found by the Iury, does amount to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance: but the other on the contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Defendants pleaded Not guilty.</p>
               <p>The Iury found the Leaſe made by the Biſhop, and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſeveral Aſſignments, and the Deviſe as in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſet forth (ſaving the Deviſe to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Butler,</hi> from the day of the death of the ſaid <hi>Ellinor</hi>) which clauſe was not found: and they found alſo, that <hi>John Butler,</hi> the 3 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3 <hi>Jacob.</hi> dyed, and that <hi>Ellinor</hi> did enter, claiming by the Deviſe, and that ſhe married the Plaintiff: and alſo their agreement to have the Manſion-houſe and Rent as a Legacy, and the entry of <hi>Thomas Butler</hi> in the reſidue by the aſſent of the Executor, and the death of <hi>Ellinor,</hi> and that the 10 <hi>l.</hi> was behinde, and that the Plaintiff took the goods, and would have detained them as a Diſtreſs, and that the Defendants reſcued them.

               <p>And I conceive Iudgment ought to be given for the Defendants.</p>
               <p>For firſt, I conceive that the Wife of <hi>John Butler</hi> had not any Rent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at all out of the houſe in which the Diſtreſs was taken.</p>
               <p>If ſhe had any Rent, yet it is determined by her death. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               </p>
               <p>And I conceive the Caſe to be thus:</p>
               <p>Leſſee for years of two houſes, does deviſe them to his Wife for 28 years (which is all the term) if ſhe live ſo long unmarryed, and after her death to <hi>Thomas Butler:</hi> and if the woman marries, that ſhe ſhall have one Meſſuage for the reſidue of the term, and 20 <hi>l.</hi> Rent <hi>ex omnibus aliis terris ſuis,</hi> with a clauſe of Diſtreſs; and then <hi>Thomas Butler</hi> ſhall have the other Meſſuage. The Deviſor makes his Wife Executrix, and dyes; and the Wife enters, claiming by the Deviſe,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54307:32"/> and then marries the Plaintiff, and then they agree to have the houſe that was deviſed to her after her marriage, with the Rent; and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Butler</hi> by their aſſent does enter into the reſidue: the Wife dyes, and the Plaintiff diſtrains for Rent behinde after her death, and the Defendants reſcue the Diſtreſs, whereupon the Plaintiff brings his Action.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, I conceive that the Wife can have no Rent by this Deviſe, and that for three Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Becauſe the Wife did take the entire term as Executrix, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe cannot have a Rent out of the ſame term: and therefore I conceive it will not be denyed, that if Leſſee for years deviſeth a Rent to <hi>I. S.</hi> and makes him his Executor, and dyes, <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall have no Rent, for in as much as he hath the term as Executor, he ſhall have no Rent as Legated, for it is extinct in the term; and although he hath one in his own right, and the other as Executor, yet cannot he have both together. 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>B. Surrend.</hi> 52. If one hath a term as Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and purchaſe the Reverſion, the Leaſe is extinct. And although the term in our caſe is deviſed to a ſtranger, yet by the Law it does firſt veſt in the Executor, and the Deviſee cannot have it without the delivery or conſent of the Executor. And if a Deviſee does enter into a term, or takes goods without the delivery of the Executor, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor may have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt him. 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 49. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 16. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 84. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30. although in the 27 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. 8. <hi>a.</hi> diverſity is taken between a thing certain and uncertain; for it is there ſaid, that if the thing deviſed be certain, and a ſtranger takes it, the Executor ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs: but in old <hi>Nat. Bre.</hi> 87. there is no diverſity.</p>
               <p>So that it is clear, that the term firſt veſteth in the Executor, and ſo the Rent which the Executor had is extinguiſhed by unity of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>

                  </label> And whereas it hath been objected, That although the term does firſt veſt in the Executor, yet when he aſſents to the Deviſe, he is then immediately in by the Deviſor, and therefore the Rent is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.</p>

                  </label> I anſwer, That there the agreement does diveſt all the Eſtate that the Deviſor had gained by his entry, but in our caſe the woman hath as high and right an Eſtate in the Land, as ſhe hath in the Rent: and although there be a poſſibility of ſevering the Land from the Rent, yet that cannot revive the Rent being extinct; as if one hath Land of the part of his Father, and hath a Rent out of the ſaid Land of the part of his Mother, the Rent is extinct, and cannot be divided, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he dye without iſſue. And that the Wife hath as high Eſtate in the Land, as ſhe hath in the Rent, appears in <hi>Cook.</hi> 6 <hi>Rep. Sanders</hi> Caſe: where if an Executor commits waſte before he aſſent to the Legacy, an Action of waſte lies againſt him, which proves, that the Executor hath the term. And although the Deviſee, after his aſſent, is in by relation by the Deviſor, yet this will not ayd the Rent, no more then if a Son having Rent out of his Fathers Land, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dyes, and the Son endows his Wife, this ſhall not revive the Rent which was extinct before, yet is the Wife in, as of the Eſtate of her Husband, and the Eſtate and poſſeſſion of the Son is utterly defeated.</p>
               <p>But admit that the Rent be not extinct, yet here is no agreement to have the Rent: for here are two Deviſes; 1. Of the Land to the Wife, if ſhe continue unmarryed, the remainder to <hi>Thomas Butler:</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54307:32"/> and the other of twenty pounds Rent to commence after her marriage, wherefore the aſſent of the Executrix to the Deviſe of the Land, is no execution of the Deviſe of the Rent, <hi>Comment.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>B.

And it is no aſſent to the Term, neither can it be taken by Implication to be any aſſent to the Deviſe of the Rent; for every Act that does enure to another Act by Implication, ought to be ſuch as of neceſſity ought to enure to the other Act which cannot be taken to be otherwiſe, and therefore 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Attornment</hi> the 8th. A Woman grants a Reverſion to which a Rent was incident, and afterwards marries the Grantee, to whom the Tenant payes the Rent, this is no Attornment, for it is indifferent whether he payes the Rent to him as Grantee, or in right of his Wife, <hi>Dyer</hi> 302. <hi>Vivors</hi> Caſe, <hi>que recover.</hi> Rents of ſeverall Tenants, as <hi>Bayly,</hi> and then they be granted to him, and after the Grant they be paid to him, this is no Attornment, for they may be paid to him as he is Baily, as well as he is Grantee. But if the Leſſee do ſurrender to him in the Reverſion, then it is a good Attornment, for a Surrender cannot be to any but to him that hath the Reverſion. And ſo in our Caſe it is cleer, that the aſſent to the Legacy of the Land it ſelf, is not any expreſſe aſſent to the Rent, nor any implyed aſſent, for there may be an aſſent to the one and not to the other, and where the Wife had aſſented to the Deviſe of the Term, ſhe hath utterly diſmiſt her ſelf of the Term as Executor, notwithſtanding the aſſent to the Rent, but having once aſſented to the Deviſe of the Term, ſhe hath no more to do with it, and therefore in ſuch Caſe the Legatee of the Rent ought to ſue in the Court <hi>Chriſtian</hi> for his remedy againſt the Executor in the ſame manner, as if a Term were deviſed to one, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor will not aſſent to it, but ſells the Term to another. And in this caſe if the Teſtator were indebted after this aſſent to the Deviſee of the Term, the Term cannot be put in execution for this Debt, but the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Wife is in her a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 21. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30 2 <hi>H</hi> 6. 16.</p>
               <p>Alſo here is no Rent deviſed out of this houſe, for the Deviſe is, <hi>Ex omnibus aliis terris ſuis,</hi> which word <hi>(all)</hi> excludes all the Lands wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of any mention was made before.</p>

               <p>And I conceive that it is Error, for the Demand ought to be as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and formall as a Writ, for the Writ of Dower being generall, <hi>De li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero tenemento,</hi> the Demand ought to make it certain, and therefore it is of the ſame nature as the Writ is, 8. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>br.</hi> 265.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54307:33"/> quod coram nobis refidet,</hi> which did alſo abate by reaſon of varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the Record and the ſecond Writ of Error, whereupon <hi>Mich.</hi> 13. <hi>Jac.</hi> the ſaid Plaintiff did purchaſe this new Writ of Error.</p>
               <p>And the Defendants did plead in abatement of the ſaid Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that the now Plaintiff before the purchaſing of the ſaid laſt Writ of Error, and ſince the purchaſing of the ſecond Writ of Error, <hi>viz.</hi> the 19th. of <hi>September,</hi> the 10. <hi>Jacob.</hi> did enter into the ſaid Land, and the ſame day and year at the place aforeſaid did deviſe the ſaid Tenements to one <hi>Thomas Alport. Habendum</hi> from the Feaſt of S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> then laſt paſt for four years next enſuing, by vertue of which Demiſe the ſaid <hi>Thomas Alport</hi> into the ſaid Tenements did enter, and was and yet is poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>Vpon which Plea the Plaintiff demurred, and the Defendants joyned.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the Plea is inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Yet I do agree that if he who hath cauſe to have a Writ of Error to reverſe a Iudgment of Land, does make a good Leaſe for years, he hath ſuſpended his Writ of Error for the Term; as he does quite extinguiſh it by his Feoffment.</p>
               <p>But here it appears that there is no Leaſe made, for it is pleaded only that the Plaintiff did enter into the Land, and it appears by the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that his entry was taken away by the Iudgment in the Aſſiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gains nothing by his Entry but the Freehold and poſſeſſion, does remain alwaies to the Defendants being Heirs to the Recovery, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Litt. Warrant.</hi> 158. If one be ſeiſed of Land, and another who hath no right doth enter into the Land and continues poſſeſſion, yet doth he gain nothing thereby, but the poſſeſſion doth alwaies continue in him that hath right, and ſo in the 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Woolocks</hi> Caſe, and in the <hi>Comment.</hi> 233. <hi>Barkleys</hi> Caſe: Execution is taken to be no plea in Bar to an <hi>Ejectment,</hi> becauſe it was ſhewed that the Lord <hi>Barkley</hi> did enter as in his Remainder, and was ſeiſed in Fee untill the Leſſor of the Plaintiff did eject him, and did demiſe to the Plaintiff, which is not good, becauſe it is not alledged that he diſſeiſed the Lord <hi>Barkley,</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he had no Eſtate to make the Leaſe, and the Entry doth not imply any diſſeiſin, or doth gain any poſſeſſion, and 11 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>B.</hi> 12 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 43. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Court did agree that the plea was inſufficient.</p>
               <p>But then it was moved that the Writ of Error was nought, for the Writ was, that <hi>Quidem Recordum &amp; proceſſus Dom. Regina Elizabeth. nuper Regina Angliae (cauſa erroris interven.) venire ſec.</hi> and it appears by the Record, that although the Recovery was removed by Writ of Error the 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> at the Suit of the Father of the Plaintiff, yet the Plaintiff did purchaſe a new Writ of <hi>Error, Mich.</hi> 9 <hi>Jacob.</hi> and had a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Heirs of the Recover or who appeared, <hi>Mich.</hi> 10. <hi>Jacob.</hi> and alſo the Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus, tales &amp; Diſtringas,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Writ is naught, for all the Recovery was not in the time of the Queen, but part in her time, and part in the Kings time.</p>
               <p>But I conceive that it is good enough, for firſt the Recovery and Proceſſe is ſatiſfied by tranſmitting the body of the Recovery, as it is proved by the uſuall form of all Writs of Error, which is to certifie the Record and Proceſſe, and yet they do certifie only the Declaration and the Pleas omitting the Writs.</p>

For if men ſay in the Country, that I am a Thief, that is no cauſe to arreſt me, but matter in fact ought to be ſhewed which is Traverſable: whereupon iſſue was taken upon the firſt matter onely; and in the ninth of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. it is holden that a man ought to ſhew ſome matter in fact to prove that the Plaintiff is ſuſpected. And 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 46. in a falſe Impriſonment; The Defendant who juſtifies upon a falſe impriſonment for Felony, ought to ſhew ſome matter in fact to induce his ſuſpicion, or that his goods were in his poſſeſſion, of which the Country may take notice. And in the 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 5. in a falſe impriſonment, the Defendant juſtified, becauſe that <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> did rob another, and did go to the houſe of the Plaintiff; whereupon the Conſtable did ſuſpect him, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Defendant to aſſiſt him in arreſting him, &amp;c. and holden there, that they ought to ſurmiſe ſome cauſe of ſuſpicion, or otherwiſe the plea was not good. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 35. Suſpicion cannot be tryed, becauſe it is but the imagination of a man, which lies in his own conceit. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. In a falſe Impriſonment, the Defendant juſtified, becauſe that <hi>A.</hi> was poyſoned, and the common voyce and fame was that it was done by the Plaintiff, whereupon he was taken; and there it was argued, if this were ſufficient cauſe; ſome ſaid that he ought to ſhew ſome ſpecial cauſe, but it was agreed in concluſion that it was: but all agreeo, that ſuſpicion only is not enough, without alledging cauſe of ſuſpicion: and ſays, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. and 7 <hi>Elizab. Dyer</hi> 236. In an action on the Caſe for calling one Thief, the Defendant juſtified for common voyce and fame, and adjudged inſufficient; but this with ſuſpicion had been ſufficient cauſe to arreſt one, and carry him to the Goal. And <hi>Michaelm.</hi> 38 and 39 <hi>Elizab.</hi> In the Common-Pleas, in an Action on the Caſe by <hi>Damport</hi> againſt <hi>Symſon,</hi> for giving a falſe teſtimony, adjudged that the intent of the ſwearers cannot be put in iſſue or tryed. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>B.</hi> 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 3. In a Treſpaſs, the Defendant juſtified that he was robbed in the County of <hi>B.</hi> and did ſuſpect the Plaintiff in the County of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> The Plaintiff pleaded, <hi>De ſon tort demeſne, &amp;c.</hi> and it was there agreed, that all the caſe was in iſſue. And <hi>Tow</hi> ſaid, that it ſhould be tryed by both Counties, if they could joyn; but he doubted if they could joyn: but in the 16 of <hi>H.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>B.</hi> this caſe is reported to be adjudged, that if the Counties could not joyn, it was no plea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ought to be tryed by both: And ſo <hi>de ſon tort demeſne</hi> ſhall be full of multiplicity, and therefore it is no plea, as in <hi>Crogates</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Bar is not good, becauſe the Defendant ſays, he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of five Steers, and doth not ſay, <hi>of the aforeſaid.</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 16. In a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought by the King of a Chantery in the Chappel of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>D.</hi> and made title to it, and the Defendant pleaded that there was a Chantery in the ſaid Chappel, and made title to it, and traverſed the title of the King, and adjudged to be no plea, becauſe he did not anſwer to the Chantry whereof the King had declared. And <hi>Paſch.</hi> 14 <hi>Elizab. Downing</hi> againſt <hi>Hayward:</hi> In a falſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Defendant did juſtifie as ſervant to <hi>A.</hi> to whom
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54307:36"/> a Commiſſion of Rebellion of Chancery was directed, and the Plaintiff pleaded <hi>De ſon tort Demeſne,</hi> and found for the Plaintiff, and reverſed again by Error in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> becauſe that when the matter of juſtification, is upon matter of Record and matter in fact, or of matters done in two Counties that cannot joyn, the Iſſue ought to be upon one only.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paſch.</hi> 15 <hi>Jac.</hi> Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff by the opinion of <hi>Mountague, Crook,</hi> and <hi>Doderidge,</hi> becauſe that all that was done after Sir <hi>Thomas Buriets</hi> Warrant was illegall, but they agreed that the Plaintiff might have an Action for the charging of Felony, and for all that was done before the ſaid Warrant. But <hi>Haughton</hi> diſagreed, who conceived that Iudgment ſhould be given for the Plaintiff, becauſe the Plea of the Defendant was no juſtification for what was done before the warrant: but at laſt Iudgment was given for the Defendant.<note place="margin">Judgment.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The Writ of Recovery was certified, and the Plaintiffs aſſigned Error; for that <hi>Katherin</hi> was within age at the time of the appearance of her and her Husband by the ſaid Attorney, and was within the age of 21 years at the time of the Iudgment (to wit) of the age of eighteen years, and no more.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Mary Taylor</hi> did plead, that before the Recovery, a Fine was levyed the 4 <hi>Septemb.</hi> 13 <hi>Elizab.</hi> between the ſaid <hi>Robert Leigh</hi> and <hi>James Haye</hi> Plaintiffs, and <hi>Thomas Leigh</hi> and <hi>Katherin</hi> his Wife, Deforceators of the ſaid Tenements: whereupon the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Katherin</hi> did acknowledg the ſaid Tenements to be the right of the ſaid <hi>Robert,</hi> &amp;c. with warranty againſt them and the Heirs of <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin;</hi> which Fine was proclaimed, &amp;c. and was to the uſe of the Conuſees and their Heirs, until the Recovery ſhould be perfected: and then the ſeventh of <hi>March,</hi> the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Writ of Entry was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, which was to the uſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Katherin</hi> his Wife in Tayl, the Remainder to <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Heir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Katherin</hi> did demiſe to the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> a Cottage and three acres of Land, parcel of the ſaid Tenements, for life, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe did demand Iudgment of the Writ againſt the Fine with proclamations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Leigh</hi> and 28 others of the Ter-tenants did plead the ſaid Fine with warranty, and that <hi>Katherin</hi> dyed without iſſue, and that <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſeiſed in fee, whoſe eſtate they have, and that <hi>Thomas</hi> dyed, and that after the death of <hi>Katherin,</hi> the ſaid warranty did deſcend to <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> as ſiſters and heirs of <hi>Katherin,</hi> and did demand Iudgment if they ſhould maintain this Writ againſt the ſaid Fine, and againſt the warranty.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiffs, as to the ſaid ſeveral pleas of non-tenure, <hi>in null. errat.</hi> the fine with proclamations, and the warranty, did ſeverally demur in Law, to which the Defendants did ſeverally joyn.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the Writ of Error does well lie, and that the Recovery is erroneous, and therefore ought to be reverſt.</p>
               <p>And for the Argument of the Caſe, I ſhall divide it into three parts:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If the Writ of Error will lie? 1. In reſpect of the Plaintiffs: 2. Notwithſtanding the plea of non-tenure pleaded in abatement thereof by <hi>Chatterton</hi> and ten others of the Ter-tenants.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Whether there be any Error in the Recovery? and if it be ſuch an Error as the Plaintiffs may aſſign?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If the Plaintiffs be barred thereof by the pleas in Bar, to wit, the Fine with proclamations pleaded by <hi>Mary Taylor,</hi> and the warranty pleaded by <hi>Robert Leigh</hi> and 28 others of the Ter-tenants, or by any of theſe pleas, or not?</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, If he in remainder, depending upon an eſtate in Tayl, may maintain a Writ of Error to reverſe a Recovery againſt the firſt Tenant in Tayl, after his death, without iſſue. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54307:40"/> clearly, that he in the remainder ſhall have a Writ of Error; for the Writ of Error doth always purſue the nature of the Land, and not the privity of the blood.</p>
               <p>And therefore 5 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Writ of Error ſhall go with the Land, and therefore the Heir in ſpecial tayl ſhall have it, although there be another Heir at the Common-Law. And ſo in <hi>Fitz Herb. N. B.</hi> 21 <hi>K.</hi> He who is Heir to the Land that is loſt, ſhall have a Writ of Error, and not the Heir at Common-Law: as if Land in <hi>Borough-Engliſh</hi> be loſt by erroneous Iudgment, the younger Son ſhall have a Writ of Error: and 3 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 19. The Heir in ſpecial tail ſhal have the Writ of Error, although there be another Heir at the Common Law. And 1 <hi>Mariae, Dyer</hi> 90. <hi>Verneys</hi> Caſe: The Writ of Error ſhall be brought by him who had the thing whereon erroneous Iudgment was given.</p>
               <p>And as the eſpecial Heir ſhall have the Writ of Error, ſo ſhall he alſo in remainder or reverſion upon an Eſtate for life, after the death of the Tenant for life. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 29.</p>
               <p>But the ſole Objection, that hath any coulor againſt this was, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that this Writ of Error ought to be given to him in remainder by the Common-Law, for it is not given by the Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te of the 9th of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and then there can be no remainder upon an Eſtate tail at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, and therefore he in ſuch remainder cannot have any Writ of Error.</p>
               <p>But this is eaſily anſwered, for the Common-Law being, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> that when an erroneous Recovery is had againſt a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rticular Tenant, that he in the Reverſion or Remainder ſhall have a Writ of Error after the determination of the particular Eſtate, it follows, that when this new particular Eſtate is made by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. he in the remainder ſhall have the ſame remedy. And this is proved by the caſe of the Tenant in Tayl, for although that his Eſtate was not at the Common-Law, yet now he ſhall have all Actions which the Common-Law gives to a Tenant in fee, which may ſtand with his Eſtate; and therefore he ſhall have a Writ of Eſcheat, a <hi>Quod per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittat: Nat. B.</hi> 124. 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 5. 48. <hi>Nat. B.</hi> 212. and ſo he ſhall have an Aſſize, and many other Writs, which lie for a Tenant in fee at the Common-Law.</p>
               <p>And for Authorities in this point, <hi>Dyer</hi> 188. That he in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder after the Eſtate-tail ſpent, ſhall have a Writ of Error, and ſo is it in <hi>Dyer</hi> 40. in <hi>Verneys</hi> Caſe. And in the 3 <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 3. <hi>B.</hi> if is reſolved, that he who hath a remainder expectant upon an Eſtate in Tayl, ſhall have a Writ of Error upon a Iudgment given againſt the Tenant in Tayl, although there were no ſuch remainder at the Common-Law; for when the Statute <hi>de Donis Conditionalibus</hi> does enable the Donor to limit a remainder upon the Eſtate-tail, all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Common-Law doth give to the privies in Eſtate, are by the ſame act as incidents tacitly given alſo according to the rule of the Common-Law: and therefore as he in Reverſion or Remainder upon an Eſtate for life, ſhall have a Writ of Error by the Common-Law upon a Iudgment given againſt a Tenant for life, although that they were not parties by <hi>Hyde, Pryer, Voucher, &amp;c.</hi> ſo ſince the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>de Donis conditionalibus</hi> ſhall he have, who hath a Reverſion or Remainder expectant upon an Eſtate in Tayl. And therefore I conceive the Writ of Error is good, notwithſtanding that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54307:41"/>
               <p>But now it is to be conſidered, if this Plea of non-tenure ſhall avoyd the Writ of Error? and I conceive it will not, for three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 1. I conceive that it is no plea to abate the Writ, for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs might have reverſed the Recovery againſt the Leſſors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion onely, without having made the Ter-tenants parties; for the Writ of Error being grounded upon the Recovery, does always lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the parties to the Iudgment, and their Heirs, and may be reverſed againſt them, although they have nothing in the Land: and this is clear by <hi>Nat. Brev.</hi> 107. and 26 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 12. A Writ of Error does lie againſt him who recovers, and after the Error found, a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall iſſue againſt the Tenant: and 42 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 22. and 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 13. Non-tenure is no plea in a Writ of Error, for the party to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or his Heir. And here in this caſe, if thoſe who have pleaded Non-tenure are not Tenants, they are at no loſs, for they can loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but this plea does diſcharge themſelves onely, and the <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> remains good againſt the Heirs, and the other Ter-tenants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Non-tenure could be a good Plea for the Ter-tenants in a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> yet at the leaſt it ought to be in ſuch a <hi>Scire facias</hi> wherein the Ter-tenants are named, and not in ſuch a general Writ as this is. For here the Plaintiffs have purſued their <hi>Scire facias</hi> in as good a form as may be, <hi>viz.</hi> generally againſt the Heirs and the Ter-tenants; and if there be any default, it is in the Sheriff who hath returned thoſe to be Tenants who indeed are not ſo, and it ſhall be very hard if the Writ ſhould abate for default of the Sheriff. 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Scir. facias</hi> 121. In a <hi>Scire facias</hi> on a Recognizance againſt the Ter-tenants, it was ſaid that one of them that ware warned had but a Leaſe for years of ſuch a one who had the Freehold.

               <p>Whereupon I obſerve that if the Writ be ſpecial, naming the Ter-tenants, as it was anciently, then it ought to be ſo: but of late ſuch courſe hath been changed, as appears by the 8 of <hi>H.</hi> 4. 18. and the Writ awarded generally, and therefore ſuch ſpecial Non-tenure ſhall be a good Plea, for it is the default of the Plaintiff to purſue his Writ againſt one who is not Tenant, but when the Writ is general, Non-tenure is no Plea to the abatement of the Writ. 48 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 15. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 18. 48 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 2. and the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>B.</hi> In a Writ of Account againſt the Sheriff of <hi>Northumberland</hi> of a Receit in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine;</hi> and it was pleaded that <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was a County of it ſelf: but becauſe it was made a County ſince the Teſte of the Writ, the Writ was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be good.</p>

               <p>And I conceive clearly that the appearance of the Wife within age by Attorney, is Error; for by the Rule of the Common Law, in every <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> whereby Land is demanded, if the Tenant appear he ought to appear either in perſon, or by one lawfully authorized by him, and that is the reaſon that if Iudgment be given againſt one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an appearance by the Attorney, where the Attorney had no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to appear, that this is Error, untill it be remedied in caſe where a Verdict is paſt by the Statute of 32 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. of <hi>Repleader,</hi> but if the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given upon default or demurrer, or upon a Verdict, and no Warranty by him who recovered, this is not Warranted by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>Dyer</hi> 93. 20 <hi>Eliz.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54307:42"/> he ſhall make defence by his Guardian, and not by his next of kin, and the Court does aſſigne a Guardian for an Infant who is Defendant, and that is commonly one of the Officers of the Court: and in 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. where <hi>Hungerford</hi> and his Wife brought an Action of Treſpaſſe for taking of their Villain being in their Service: The Defendant plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was free, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as to the loſing of the Service that he was not retained, and found for the Plaintiff, and ſeverall damages, <hi>viz.</hi> for the taking of nine and twenty pounds, and for the loſing of the Service twenty ſhillings.

               <p>And this Caſe is not to be reſembled to the Caſe of a Fine levied by an Infant which cannot be reverſed by any but by the Infant himſelf, and the ſame Law is of a Recognizance by an Infant, and the reaſon of theſe Caſes is, becauſe it is the Act of the Court, to admit him to levy a Fine, or to acknowledge a Recognizance, and therefore this ought to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Court, and that muſt be by inſpection of the Infant, and therefore it ought to be done during nonage.</p>

               <p>Secondly for the matter, this Fine being precedent to the Recovery whereby the cauſe of this Action is given, cannot extinguiſh it: for it is a Rule in Law, that one cannot give or grant that which one hath not, 22 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Kelway</hi> 84.

               <p>And ſo in our Caſe if the Plaintiffs ſhould be barred in the writ of Error by the Fine, they ſhall be without remedy, although that the Fine be erroneous, as I conceive it to be, for if they bring a writ of Error to reverſe the Fine firſt, the Recovery although it be erroneous will be a clear Bar to them as it is adjudged in the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Burton</hi> and <hi>Lever.</hi>

And ſo prayed the Opinion of the Court.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgment.</p>
               <p>And in this caſe, are two matters conſiderable: Firſt, if this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the Lord, and the entry into the Roll, and the delivery of a Copy entred by the Steward, be any admittance or not.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that it is no admittance: For an admittance is a ceremony requiſite to make a Copyhold Eſtate, and is ſo neceſſary, that before admittance, he to whoſe uſe the Surrender is made, hath no Eſtate: as in <hi>Bracton</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Si ipſe ad alium transferre voluerit prius illud reſtituet domino, vel ſervienti, ſi dominus praeſens non fuerit, &amp; de manibus illorum fiat tranſlatio ad alium, &amp;c.</hi> And before admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, this is no perfect aſſurance, but onely begins then, as in <hi>Peryams</hi> Caſe: <hi>Cook.</hi> 5 <hi>R.</hi> If the Tenant makes a Feoffment, and is not preſent within the year at the Court, and there enters it, it ſhall be voyd: There the Feoffment is but <hi>opus inchoatum,</hi> as it is there reſolved, and is not perfected until it be preſented and entered. And I conceive that this admittance of a Copyholder is like to a Freehold at Law, in which caſe nothing paſſeth by the Deed till the Livery be made.</p>
               <p>And now it is to be conſidered, whether there be any thing here to make the admittance? for firſt, there is no expreſs admittance, but if there be any admittance, it ought to be implied: and I agree that if there be any act to imply the conſent of the Lord to this Surrender, it ſhall be a good admittance: but here is no ſuch thing. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make an implyed admittance ought to be taken and collected out of theſe four things contained in the Verdict.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And I conceive that none of theſe do imply an admittance.</p>
               <p>For firſt, no act by the homage can make an admittance; for they cannot make an actual admittance, and therefore they cannot by any implyed act make an admittance. Then here is not any act made by the Lord himſelf amounting to an admittance, for there is nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound to be done by him.</p>
               <p>And as to the acts made by the Steward they are three: Firſt, the acceptance of the preſentment which is no admittance, for he being Iudg of the Court is bound by the Law to receive the Preſentments offered to him by the homage. Secondly, The Entry in the Roll, and this is alſo his duty to do for the evidence of the Lord, and of him to whoſe uſe the Surrender is made. Thirdly, The delivery of the Copy of the Preſentment, which alſo ought to be done, becauſe that ſerves for <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> for his evidence when he was admitted.</p>
               <p>But none of theſe things do imply the conſent or will of the Lord, that <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall be admitted, or that he ſhall have the Land according to the Surrender; for when the Law implies any act out of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54307:46"/> the act of the party, the act of the party ought to be ſuch, as does neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuch a thing to be implyed by the Law, and that to be ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the act of the party cannot be, unleſs the Act to be implyed be alſo done. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. If Tenant for life does ſurrender to the Grantee of the Reverſion, this is firſt an Attornment implyed by the Law, for otherwiſe the ſurrender can take no effect. And 5 <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 15. If a Parſon makes a Leaſe for years to the Patron who grants over the Leaſe, this does imply a confirmation of the Leaſe, for otherwiſe the Grant of the Patron ſhall be avoyded. And ſo in our Caſe, if the ſecond Surrender had been made to the Lord in Court, I do agree that it ſhall be an implyed admittance of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> upon the firſt Surrender. But when the act of the party may be without any ſuch implication, and the matter to be implyed reſts indifferent, then it is quite contrary. 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Attornment</hi> 8. Feme ſole grants a Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to which a Rent is incident, and names the Grantee, to whom the Tenant pays the Rent, this is no Attornment; for it is indifferent whether he pays this to the Grantee as Grantee, or in right of his Wife. <hi>Vide</hi> 13 <hi>Elizab. Dyer</hi> 302.</p>
               <p>Then in our Caſe, The acception of the Surrender, the Entry in the Roll, and the delivery of the Copy of the preſentment are things indifferent, and are not ſuch acts as neceſſarily imply any admittance, for all of them may be done, although no admittance be made.</p>
               <p>46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Forfeiture.</hi> A Biſhop made a Gift of Land in Tayl, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Rent, the Dean and Chapter did releaſe part of the Rent, this is a confirmation of the Gift, for it is neceſſarily implyed, for otherwiſe the reſidue of the Rent cannot be. But if they had onely entered the Gift of the Biſhop in their Regiſter, or in an Inſtrument under their ſeal, I conceive this ſhall be no confirmation; for it may be that they made this, that the ſucceſſor ſhould be the better able to avoyd it.</p>
               <p>And ſo in the caſe of the Patron aforeſaid, if the Patron had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Leaſe in one of his Evidences, or in an Inſtrument under his ſeal, this is not any confirmation; for it may be that he did it for his better remembrance of the Eſtate granted, and to the intent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ſucceſſor to avoyd it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive until the admittance of him to whoſe uſe the Surrender is made, the Eſtate of the Copyholder does remain in <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shercliff</hi> who made the Surrender: for it cannot be in <hi>Staniland,</hi> to whom the Surrender was made, becauſe the Surrender does make no Eſtate until admittance: for the Heir of the Copyhold hath the Eſtate of the Copyhold in him before any admittance, becauſe that he hath an Eſtate deſcended to him from his Anceſtor; for if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Eſtate ſhall be in abeyance, which ſhall be inconvenient; but <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> hath nothing until admittance. And in the 5 <hi>Rep. Periams</hi> Caſe: A Feoffment by Franktenant of the Mannor of <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> ſhall be voyd, if it be not preſented at the next Court, where it is reſolved that the cuſtom is good, and that the Feoffment is not fall and perfect until the preſentment in Court according to the cuſtom, but it is as <hi>opus inchoatum &amp; non perfectum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo in our caſe, the Surrender is no perfect aſſurance to paſs the Eſtate, until there be an admittance thereupon: and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that until admittance, the Eſtate doth remain in him who made the Surrender.</p>
               <p>And in the Caſe of <hi>Froſell</hi> and <hi>Walſh,</hi> adjudged in this Court the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54307:47"/> laſt Term, where <hi>Thomas Herring</hi> a Copyholder in Fee of the Manor of <hi>Manſel-Lacy,</hi> the 28 <hi>Elizab.</hi> according to the cuſtom did ſurrender into the hands of two Tenants out of the Court, to the uſe of <hi>George Whittington</hi> and others under whom the Defendant claimed, and it was found by the cuſtom that ſuch Surrender ought to be preſented at the next Court, or that otherwiſe it ſhould be voyd. <hi>Thomas Herring</hi> dyed, <hi>Henry Herring</hi> being his Son and Heir, and before any Court holden, or any admittance of <hi>George Whittington, Henry Whittington</hi> did enter, and made the Leaſe to the Plaintiff, who brought an Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it was adjudged for him: for it was reſolved, that until ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance the Eſtate remained in him who made the Surrender, which by his death deſcended to <hi>Henry</hi> his Heir.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54307:47"/> and made the Leaſe to the Plaintiff, upon whom the Defendant did enter.</p>
               <p>And prayed the Opinion of the Court, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And I conceive Iudgment ought to be given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But firſt, as to the Queſtion that hath been made, <hi>ſcil.</hi> What Eſtate <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Roger Wittingbury</hi> ſhall take (if they ſhall take any Eſtate at all) by this Will? I ſhall not argue: for I agree, that if they have any Eſtate, it is a Fee-ſimple, in reſpect of the continual and perpetual charge impoſed upon them for the payment of 6 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> to the Wardens, &amp;c. for that is to have a perpetual continuance in reſpect of the perſons to whom it is to be payd, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Poor. And alſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to pay are the two <hi>Wittingburies</hi> and their ſucceſſors, who in the Expoſition of the Will ſhall be taken for their Heirs and Aſſigns: and alſo in reſpect of the limitation of the payment, <hi>ſcil. [for ever]</hi> which in a Will makes a Fee-ſimple: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>s much as the charge is to continue for ever, it follows alſo that the Eſtate ought to continue, for without the Eſtate the charge cannot be.</p>
               <p>But I conceive that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> ſhall take nothing by this will, or at leaſt that they ſhall take but a future Eſtate to begin after the death of <hi>Francis</hi> without Heir, and then their time will never come, for <hi>John Savage</hi> under whom the Defendant doth derive his Eſtate, is Heire to <hi>Francis,</hi> and therefore the Plaintiff nor his Leſſor, being Heire to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Wittingb.</hi> the Survivor cannot have this houſe.</p>
               <p>And to prove this, here is an Eſtate limited by expreſſe words to <hi>Francis</hi> and his Heirs, and no apparent intent by the Deviſor, that the word <hi>(Heirs)</hi> ſhall be reſtrained to the Heirs of his body, unleſſe by reaſon of the limitation of the Remainders afterwards, which cannot be (as hath been ſaid) if <hi>Francis</hi> had a Fee-ſimple. But as to this I ſay, that the ſame reaſon may be given, when a man deviſeth Land to <hi>A.</hi> and his Heires, and if he die without Heire, that it ſhall remain to <hi>B.</hi> and his Heires, in which caſe if the Deviſe to <hi>A.</hi> ſhall be reſtrained to an Eſtate in Taile, the Remainder to be is good, but no ſuch intent can be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt expreſſe words, and therefore the Remainder is utterly void, as in 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>B.</hi> where the Rule is given, that when the intent of the Teſtator does not agree with the Law, his intent ſhall be void, and this is a certain Rule. And <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. where it is provided, <hi>Quod vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas donatoris obſervetur,</hi> yet it ought alwaies to agree with the Rules of Law, as is proved by the 8. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 33. where was a Gift in Taile to two, and if one dies, that the Survivor ſhall have all to him and the heirs of his body, now doth the Law ſay that they have ſeverall Inheritances, but the will of the Donor was, that the Survivor ſhould have all, which being repugnant to the Rule of Law, was adjudged to be a void Clauſe, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Eſtates</hi> 75. Eſtates given to the husband and wife for their lives, the Remainder to the heires of their bodies is an Eſtate-taile exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, notwithſtanding the expreſſe will of the Donor, becauſe an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for life and of Inheritance cannot be diſtinct in one and the ſame perſon without a mean Eſtate in another. So that in Wills, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent be againſt Law, they are void: And ſo is it if the intent be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous and not manifeſtly to be collected out of the words of the Will.

               </p>
               <p>That the 28 <hi>Junii,</hi> 13 <hi>Jacob. Duffield</hi> and <hi>Babington</hi> by Deed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, and for a ſum of mony, did bargain and ſell the ſaid Toll to <hi>John Richardſon</hi> and his Heirs.</p>
               <p>That the third of <hi>June</hi> in the ſaid year, <hi>John Richardſon</hi> did bargain and ſell the Toll to the ſaid <hi>William Lerret</hi> and his Heirs.</p>
               <p>And the Plaintiff before the Treſpaſs was poſſeſt as well of the ſaid Steer as of thirty nine others, and that the ſaid Plaintiff at the time aforeſaid did drive the ſaid Cattel by the ſaid <hi>Willow-Bridg</hi> and St. <hi>Mary-Bridg,</hi> whereupon the ſaid <hi>William Lerret</hi> did demand of the Plaintiff 12 <hi>d.</hi> for Toll of the ſaid fourty Cattel, which the Plaintiff did refuſe; whereupon the ſaid <hi>William</hi> in his own right, and the other as his ſervant, did take the ſaid Steer by diſtreſs for the ſaid 12 <hi>d.</hi> And prayed ayd of the King, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff replyed, that the ſaid <hi>Willow-Bridg</hi> and St. <hi>Mary-Bridg</hi> were common Bridges for paſſage for all the Kings Subjects of the City of <hi>York,</hi> and other Cities and Towns in the North parts to <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London,</hi> and to the Cities and Towns in the South parts, at their pleaſure with Carts, &amp;c. and that neither at the making of the Letters Patents, nor at any time before, any Toll was taken or received for any paſſages over the Bridges aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Defendants demurred in Law, and the Plaintiffs joyned.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>IN an Information upon the Statute of 39 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. as well for the King as for himſelf, for that one hundred acres of Land in <hi>Nether-Winchenden</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> 17 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and before the 24 of <hi>Octob.</hi> 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> were converted from tillage to ſheep-paſture, and graſing of Cattel, which 100 acres were arable Land, ſuch as were uſed in tillage for twelve years together next before the ſaid converſion, according to the nature of the ſoyl and courſe of til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in that part of the Country: and that the ſaid 100 acres were not reſtored to tillage, nor layd for tillage before the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1599. nor ever ſince: And that the Defendant the 26 of <hi>March,</hi> the 13 of King <hi>James,</hi> was occupier of the ſaid hundred acres, and did ſo continue until the 27 <hi>Martii,</hi> 14 <hi>Jacob.</hi> and that the Defendant the 27 of <hi>March</hi> did not reſtore nor lay to tillage the ſaid hundred acres, but for the ſaid time converted them into paſture, contrary to the form of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded Not guilty.</p>
               <p>And the Iury for the fifty acres of Land did finde the converſion after the 17 of <hi>November,</hi> 1 <hi>Elizab.</hi> and before the 24 of <hi>October,</hi> the 39 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and that they were uſed in tillage for twelve years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the ſaid converſion, and that they were not reſtored to til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage before the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1599. nor ever ſince: and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant the 26 <hi>Martii,</hi> 13 <hi>Jacob.</hi> was occupier of the ſaid fifty acres from that time unto the 27 <hi>Martii,</hi> 14 <hi>Jacob.</hi> continuing his occupation thereof, and was not occupier thereof before the 26 <hi>Martii,</hi> 13 of King <hi>James:</hi> And that the Defendant, nor any other, before the 27 <hi>Martii,</hi> 14 <hi>Jacob.</hi> reſtored or layd the ſaid fifty acres to tillage, but continued them in Paſture during the ſaid time: And prayed the advice of the Court.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given for the King and the Informer for 50 <hi>l. (viz.)</hi> twenty ſhillings for every one of the ſaid fifty acres.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe the Statute hath two clauſes, the firſt is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and this doth conſiſt of two parts: 1.

               <p>The ſecond clauſe doth contain the forfeiture, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That if any ſhall offend againſt the premiſſes, every ſuch perſon ſhall forfeit for every acre not reſtored, or not continued as is aforeſaid, 20 <hi>s.</hi> for every year that he ſo offends.</p>
               <p>And Iudgment<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> was given for the King and the Informer, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Statute ſhall be utterly defrauded: for if no information be for the converſion within one year after, or if the Convertor pay the penalty of 20 <hi>s.</hi> for the converting, he may let it out to another: And by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Defendants Councel, he ſhall not be ſubject to penalty for the continuance: But the Court agreed, that he who made the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be puniſhed, and ſo ſhould every other occupyer of the Land who does not keep the Land in tillage.</p>

               <p>And although the Plaintiff did perform all, yet the Defendant did not pay the 10 <hi>l.</hi> the 16 of <hi>June</hi> next.</p>
               <p>And hereupon the Defendant demurred in Law, and the Plaintiff joyned, and Iudgment given for the Plaintiff: whereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant brought this Writ of Error.</p>

               <p>The ſecond was, that the Arbitrators did not make any Award for <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> ſeiſed of an Advowſon in Taile to him and the Heirs males of his body, the Remainder to the right Heirs of Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Knightley</hi> his Father then dead, the 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> did give and grant the Advowſon in Fee to the uſe of himſelf for the life of <hi>Urſula Knightley,</hi> the Remainder to <hi>Richard</hi> his Son and <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, and the heirs males of the body of <hi>Richard,</hi> the Remainder to the right heirs of the ſaid Sir <hi>Richard</hi> the Father. The twentieth of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 6 <hi>Eliz. William Briggs</hi> the Incumbent does make a Leaſe of the Rectory by Indenture, to <hi>Richard</hi> the Son for ſixty one years, from the Annunciation next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rendring twenty eight pounds Rent.</p>
               <p>And the twenty fourth of <hi>Febr.</hi> 6 <hi>Eliz. Valentine Knightley</hi> does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Leaſe; and the laſt of <hi>February</hi> in the ſame year, the Ordinary confirms it.</p>
               <p>The thirtieth of <hi>July</hi> in the ſame year, <hi>Richard</hi> the Leſſee grants the Term to <hi>Edward Knightley</hi> his ſecond Son within age, and takes the profits to his uſe. And the 8. of <hi>Eliz. Valentine</hi> dies, <hi>Richard</hi> being his eldeſt Son: <hi>William Briggs</hi> dies, whereby Sir <hi>Richard</hi> does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>William Reynolds</hi> who was admitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he did reſigne, whereby Sir <hi>Richard</hi> did preſent <hi>Burdſale, &amp;c.</hi> who did reſigne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby he preſented <hi>Rogers,</hi> and all theſe perſons did receive the Rent. And the 21 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard</hi> did make a Leaſe of the Rectory to <hi>Rogers</hi> the Parſon for forty yeares, if he ſhall be there Parſon ſo long. 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard</hi> grants the Advowſon to <hi>Valentine</hi> his Son in fee: and 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> A Fine was levied of the Advowſon between <hi>Bartholomew Tate,</hi> and <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> Plaintiffs, and <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceator, to the uſe of the Conuſees and their heirs; <hi>Rogers</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, whereby the ſaid <hi>Valentine</hi> did preſent <hi>John Challoner, &amp;c.</hi> who died, and the Ordinary collated the Plaintiff by <hi>Laps,</hi> who for many years accepted the Rent, and the Defendant did take and carry the Tithes to the value of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>And whether this Leaſe be good to bind the Plaintiff, or not, is the queſtion, and I conceive it is not.</p>
               <p>And for the arguing of this Caſe I will conſider theſe three things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Validity of the Leaſe without any confirmation.</p>
               <p>If here be any confirmation of this Leaſe, and if it continues in force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> againſt the now Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Admitting here be not any ſufficient confirmation of it ſelf, if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Fine levied by <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> hath given any force and ſtrength to it.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54307:53"/>
               <p>And as to the firſt I conceive without any doubt that this Leaſe without any confirmation is determined by the death of the perſon who made it, and is ſo determined as no acceptance of Rent by the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor can make it good, and therefore the difference is between a Leaſe for life, and a Leaſe for years made by a perſon rendring Rent, for the Leaſe for life is only voidable, and not void by the death of the Leſſor, ſo that if the Succeſſor does accept the Rent and Fealty, he ſhall be bound for his time, as in 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and 8 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 10. and 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. The Succeſſor ſhall maintain an Action of Waſte againſt ſuch Leſſee for life, but a Leaſe for years is meerly determined by the death of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, 38 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Leaſes</hi> 18. and 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. There a diverſity is taken and agreed between a Leaſe for life made by a Parſon in which caſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Rent or fealty by the Succeſſor ſhall make it good, for his time, and a Leaſe for years which is meerly determined by the death of the Leſſor, ſo that no acceptance of the Rent or fealty can make it good, and therefore the acceptance of the Rent in our caſe, which is found to be made by the Leſſor himſelf, and all the ſucceeding perſons, and alſo by the Rule of theſe Books, is nothing to the purpoſe, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak no more of that, <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Dyer</hi> 239.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as to the ſecond Point, <hi>ſc.</hi> If here be any ſufficient confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Leaſe againſt the Plaintiff, or not; The Defendant hath endeavoured to have many things to be found by the Iury to make a confirmation. 1. The expreſſe confirmation by <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> the Father of Sir <hi>Richard.</hi> 2. The Grant of the Leaſe by Sir <hi>Richard</hi> to <hi>Edward Knightley</hi> his Son. 3. The taking of the Profits by Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> to the uſe of his Son being within age. 4. The Leaſe made by Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> the 21. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> to <hi>Rogers</hi> the Incumbent: for I cannot conceive for what cauſe any of theſe things are found, unleſſe it be to opperate as to a confirmation.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, third, and fourth, I do conceive, that they nor none of them can make this Leaſe good, for by the firſt it is found that <hi>Valentine</hi> at the making of his confirmation had but an Eſtate for life of <hi>Urſula Knightley,</hi> the which is meerly determined by the death of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,</hi> and although <hi>Urſula</hi> be not found dead, yet is not that materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for this Advowſon being a thing that lies only in Grant and not in Law, cannot go to any Occupant. And therefore the death of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> hath determined this as fully, as if <hi>Urſula</hi> had been dead. And therefore the diverſity is when a rent or other thing which lies in grant is granted to one and his heirs for the life of another, and the Grantee dies; I agree that the heir by ſpeciall limitation ſhall have this: as <hi>Littleton</hi> 169. 19 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Account</hi> 56. but no Eſtranger can have it, and the reaſon is, becauſe that the ſole means that the Law doth give to one to gain an Eſtate of Occupancy is by Entry, but no Entry can be in an Advowſon, Rent. or any other thing that lies in Grant, and therefore here can be no Occupancy, 26. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 38. and 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. If he in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion doth enter after the Occupant, and brings an Action againſt him, the Occupant ought to plead the Leaſe for <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> whoſe Eſtate he hath, but for a Rent or an Eſtate that lies in Grant, none can plead a <hi>que Eſtate,</hi> but ought to entitle himſelf by the Grant, and that cannot any one do in this Caſe. And as to the third matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, which is the taking of the Profits by Sir <hi>Richard Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> this cannot be any confirmation of the Leaſe, for although the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Patron be ſufficient, yet it ought to be by Deed, otherwiſe it cannot be good. And as to the fourth, which is the Leaſe made by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54307:53"/> Sir <hi>Richard</hi> by <hi>Rogers</hi> the Incumbent, that is not any confirmation. 1. Becauſe this Leaſe does not concern the Leaſe made by <hi>Briggs,</hi> but is an abſolute and originall Leaſe made by Sir <hi>Richard</hi> himſelf as Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Rectory. 2. Becauſe that at the making of this, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had nothing in the Rectory, for he had granted all his term before to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Knightley,</hi> and therefore his Leaſe to <hi>Rogers</hi> is void, unleſſe it be by way of <hi>Eſtoppell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then as to the ſecond matter of confirmation, <hi>ſc.</hi> whether the Grant of the Term by Sir <hi>Richard</hi> to <hi>Edward Knightley,</hi> I will not agree to it at all, but according to the reſolution in <hi>Hodges</hi> caſe, that this is a confirmation as good as Sir <hi>Richard</hi> could make it. But this confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being in the nature of a charge upon the Advowſon, ought to be directed by the Eſtate which Sir <hi>Richard</hi> then had, and being derived out of that Eſtate, it cannot endure longer then the Eſtate; as in <hi>Littleton</hi> 122. a. If a Parſon doth charge the Glebe, and the Patron and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary confirm it, the Grant ſhall be in force, but in ſuch caſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron ought to have an Eſtate in fee, for if he hath an Eſtate but for life or in Taile, the Grant is good but during his life, and the life of the Parſon who grants it, 31 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Grants</hi> 61. A Parſon grants an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to a Pryor which is confirmed by the Tenant in Dower of the Advowſon. this is not good after the death of the Tenant in Dower, and <hi>Dyer</hi> 252. A Chantry Prieſt made a Leaſe for ninety nine years, which was confirmed by the Patron who was Tenant in Taile, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chantry is diſſolved by the 1. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. it is a queſtion if the King ſhall avoid the Leaſe, but it was agreed clearly, that if the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had continued, that the Leaſe ſhould be void againſt the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, who comes in upon the preſentation of the Tenant in Taile.</p>
               <p>And this Rule being clear (as I conceive it is) that the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall not bind according to the Eſtate of the Patron, the Eſtate which Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had in the Advowſon at the time of his aſſignment, which does imply a confirmation is to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>And as to that, the Caſe is, That <hi>Valentine</hi> being Tenant in Tail of the Advowſon, by Deed did give and grant the Advowſon to one in fee to the uſe of himſelf, during the life of <hi>Urſula,</hi> the Remainder to the uſe of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> being his Iſſue in Taile, and thereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had an Advowſon in Remainder in Fee-taile, depending on an Eſtate for anothers life, but this fee was determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the death of <hi>Valentine</hi> the Tenant in Taile.</p>
               <p>But objection was made in the Argument againſt one, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon being found to be granted by <hi>Valentine,</hi> ſhall be intended to paſſe by Livery (for it was ſaid that an Advowſon might paſſe by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) and then here is a diſcontinuance.</p>
               <p>But I deny firſt that an Advowſon can paſſe by Livery, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it would, yet ſecondly, Shall it not be taken by this Verdict to paſſe ſo. And as to the firſt, I muſt confeſſe that there are ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain opinions in your Book, that an Advowſon may paſſe by Livery, as 43 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 5. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 4. and 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. yet are there many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities againſt it, and ſo is the true reaſon of the Law. 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Shard,</hi> It was never heard that one could enter into an Advowſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Livery can be made: and 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 3. 6. An Advowſon in groſſe cannot paſſe without Deed, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 47. <hi>a.</hi> One cannot grant <hi>Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam advocationem</hi> without Deed, <hi>Dyer</hi> 323. Advowſon of the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge of <hi>D.</hi> doth paſſe by the Grant of all hereditaments in <hi>D.</hi> although it lies not in Livery, nor is viſible, and <hi>Coke</hi> 9. <hi>Rep.</hi> 96. An Advowſon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54307:54"/> is not manuall, but is <hi>Haereditas incorporata;</hi> and ſo <hi>Littleton</hi> 3. of things which do not lye in manuall occupation or poſſeſſion, as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon, he ſhall not plead as ſeiſed in his Demeſne as of fee, but as of fee: and ſo <hi>Littleton</hi> 139. If Tenant in Taile grants the Advowſon it is no diſcontinuance.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is apparent, becauſe that nothing can paſſe by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but that whereof poſſeſſion may be taken by the Feoffor or Donor, and given to him by the Feoffee or Donee. And it is more colourable to ſay that he in Reverſion upon an Eſtate for life may make Livery, for although a Reverſion be not viſible or mannuall, yet <hi>Terra rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens</hi> which the Grantee ſhall have after the Eſtate determined is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, and yet I conceive that none will hold that ſuch a Reverſion ſo long as it continues a Reverſion may paſſe by Livery.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If it be admitted that an Advowſon may paſſe by Livery, yet it ſhall be intended by this Verdict that it doth not paſſe, becauſe it is found that <hi>Valentine</hi> did grant it by Deed, and there is no doubt but it may paſſe by Deed without Livery, and therefore no Livery being found, Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall not be intended, for it ſhall not be intended to be a diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereby the Tenant in Taile ſhall do wrong, when the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may well paſſe by Deed which is no wrong. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that notwithſtanding this objection that here is no diſcontinuance but only a grant of an Advowſon, which is determinable by the death of the Tenant in Taile who made it, from whence it follows, that Sir <hi>Richard</hi> at the time of his grant of the Leaſe, had only a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fee in the Advowſon determinable on the death of <hi>Valentine</hi> his Father, which Eſtate is only charged by his confirmation, for as Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in Taile he cannot make any confirmation, becauſe he had nothing in him at that time, 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Confirmation</hi> 22. If the Son confirmes the Eſtate of the Diſſeiſor in the life of his Father, and the Father dies, the Son ſhall not be barred by his confirmation without War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty.</p>
               <p>13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Confirmation</hi> 19. If one doth quit Claime for him and his heirs, all his Right before that his Right doth happen, the quite claim is nothing, and ſo is <hi>Littleton</hi> 106. <hi>Releaſes,</hi> and the reaſon of theſe Caſes is upon the Rule of the Common Law, which is, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant or charge that which one hath not.</p>
               <p>By which it plainly appears that this implyed Confirmation made by Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> does make the Leaſe good only for ſo long time, as he hath Eſtate in the Advowſon, which is determinable by the death of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi> And to prove that it is ſo determinable, it is a certain Rule, that all Grants and Charges made by Tenant in taile are determined with his life: and ſo is <hi>Littleton, Diſcontinuance</hi> 139. If Tenant in taile of an Advowſon or Common does grant this in fee, it is no Diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, for the Grantee hath no Eſtate but for life of the Tenant in taile who made the Grant, 22 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſcontinuance</hi> 52. If a Rent be granted to husband and wife in fee, and the husband grants this in fee and dies, yet the wife may diſtrain, and ſhall not be put to her Action, 36. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 8. Tenant in taile of a Reverſion grants the ſame in fee with Warranty, and dies leaving Aſſets, the Tenant for life dies, and the Iſſue enters, and his entry congeable, for the Grant is meerly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by his death, ſo that the Warranty cannot work, 38 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>b. Diſcontinuance</hi> 35. If the King Tenant in taile grants the Land for lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is no diſcontinuance, for a Grant without Livery makes no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, but this ſhall not bind but during the life of the Grantor,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54307:54"/> 26 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>Fineaux,</hi> Tenant in taile of Services is like Tenant for life, and by his Grant nothing doth paſſe but for his life, and after his death the Iſſue may diſtrain, but if he brings a <hi>Formedon</hi> he ſhall be barred by the Warranty, for then he admits it to be a Diſcontinuance. And <hi>Hil.</hi> 39 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 941. In the Common Pleas between <hi>Keen</hi> and <hi>Cox, Thomas Jennings</hi> Tenant in taile, the Remainder to <hi>John</hi> his Brother, made a Leaſe for three lives, according to the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. with Warranty, and dies without Iſſue, <hi>John</hi> being his heire who entered, and agreed good, for the Eſtate of the Leſſee was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the death of the Leſſor without Iſſue, wherefore the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty could be no bar to the Remainder: And although the Iſſue in caſe of Grant of a Rent by his Anceſtor, may have a <hi>Formedon,</hi> yet that is no proof that the Grant is not determined, for although it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, yet may he admit himſelf out of poſſeſſion if he will, and is like to the Caſe where one takes my Rent, yet he gains no poſſeſſion by this, but that I may diſtrain notwithſtanding, yet if I will I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the poſſeſſion to be out of me, and ſo maintain an Aſſiſe againſt the <hi>Pernor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the opinion in the caſe of Fines in the 3. <hi>Rep.</hi> That if there be Tenant in taile of a Rent, or a thing which lies in Grant, who grants the ſame by Fine, and dies before the Proclamations made, that the Grant is not determined, but that the Proclamations may be made is grounded upon the reaſonable conſtruction of the Statute of the 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. of Fines, for otherwiſe the proviſion of the Statute that the fine ſhall be a bar cannot be, for that is the reaſon there given.</p>
               <p>But it hath been objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that becauſe it was not found by the Iury that Sir <hi>Richard Knightley</hi> was dead, it ſhall be intended that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and then his confirmation remains in force.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. That his being alive cannot be preſumed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> becauſe it is not ſo found, for although a Fee-ſimple being once alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſhall be intended to continue untill the contrary appears, yet is it not ſo of an Eſtate-taile, or ſuch other particular Eſtate, but he who will take advantage of ſuch Eſtate ought to aver the continuance thereof, and that is a certain Rule in pleading, as in the 15 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Taile of a Rent grants the Rent over, the Grantee when he makes Title there, ought to aver the life of the Tenant in Taile for by his death the Grant is determined; <hi>vide Dyer</hi> 73. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 73. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 39. 15 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>And although there is a ſpeciall Verdict in our Caſe, which ſhall be taken more favourably then a Plea, yet is it all one, for I agree that a Verdict need not be ſo formall as a Plea, but if it wants ſubſtance ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the one party or the other, this ſhall prejudice the party as much as if there had been a pleading, for the Court cannot give Iudgment without ſome matter found, and therefore for as much as in our Caſe the life of Sir <hi>Richard</hi> makes for the Defendant, and all the validity of his Leaſe depends thereon, he ought to prove by evidence that Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was alive, ſo that the Iury might have found it, and becauſe it was not ſo found, the Court will not intend that he is alive, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall be taken to be dead, and ſo his confirmation is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>But admitting it ſhall be intended that he is alive, yet I conceive that immediatly upon the death of <hi>Valentine,</hi> his Eſtate which he had by the limitation of the uſe is determined and vaniſht, and he is remitted to his Eſtate-taile, and then his confirmation (as I have already proved) which doth charge the Eſtate which he hath by limitation of the uſe cannot endure.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:54307:55"/>
               <p>Yet I will agree, that if Tenant in Taile makes a Feoffment to the uſe of himſelf for life, and after to the uſe of his Iſſue being within age, and dies, that his Iſſue ſhall not be remitted, as it is reſolved in the <hi>Comment.</hi> 111. <hi>Townſends</hi> Caſe, and 207. <hi>Standbridge</hi> and <hi>Morgans</hi> Caſe. But the diverſity is when the Eſtate-taile is diſcontinued wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Entry of the Iſſue is taken away, and he is put to his <hi>Forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> there he ſhall not be admitted for the limitation of a uſe to him, for if he will take the Eſtate according to the uſe he ought to take it in the ſame manner as he had the uſe, but when no diſcontinuance is made of the Eſtate-taile it is otherwiſe, as in <hi>Townſends</hi> Caſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 111. Where <hi>Amy</hi> the wife of-<hi>Roger Townſend</hi> was Tenant in Taile, and the Husband the 29. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. made a Feoffment to the uſe of himſelf and his wife for life, the Remainder to the uſe of their eldeſt Son for life, with divers Remainders over, the husband and wife di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reſolved that neither the wife nor the Son are remitted, and the reaſon there was, becauſe that the Feoffment being made before the Statute of 32. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was a Diſcontinuance, to the purging of which, the wife was driven to her <hi>Cui in vita,</hi> and cannot avoid this by Entry, as ſhe might after the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and therefore it is there agreed that if a Diſſeiſor make a Feoffment to the uſe of the Diſſeiſee, and he enters, he is remitted, becauſe his Entry was congeable: And ſo <hi>Dyer</hi> 191. 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Land is given to the husband and wife, and to the Heirs of the body of the husband, the husband after the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. makes a Feoffment to the uſe of himſelf and his wife for life, the Remainder to the firſt Son for life, the Remainder to the right heirs of the husband, the husband dies, and it was reſolved in the Court of Wards, that the wife ſhould be remitted, notwithſtanding the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Vſes, becauſe that her Entry was congeable: and ſo 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>a.</hi> If the ſon diſſeiſeth the Diſſeiſor of his Father, and the Father dies, now foraſmuch as that a right of Entry was in the Father, which by his death doth deſcend to the Son, he ſhall be remitted, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he came to the poſſeſſion by his own proper and wrongfull Act, which is as ſtrong againſt a Remitter, as an Agreement is to a Vſe. And ſo if the Son and another doth diſſeiſe the Father, and the Father dies, the Son is remitted, and ſhall put out his companion.</p>
               <p>And then Sir <hi>Richard</hi> being remitted, the Confirmation (as I have ſhewed before) being but a charge upon the Advowſon, is meerly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and ſo <hi>Littleton</hi> 148. <hi>B.</hi> If Tenant in Taile enfeoffs his Iſſue within age, who at full age doth grant a Rent-charge, or a Common, and the Father dies, the Iſſue ſhall hold diſcharged: and 40 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 448. If Tenant enfeoff a ſtranger who grants a Rent, and enfeoffs his Son within age, and the Tenant in Taile dies, the Iſſue ſhall hold the Land diſcharged: and the ſame Law by <hi>Catesby, in</hi> 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>b.</hi> If Tenant in Taile after Diſcontinuance does repurchaſe the Land, and dies, and the reaſon is, becauſe the Statute that was charged is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht. And although that the opinion of <hi>Bromley,</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 51. <hi>b.</hi> be that the Iſſue in ſuch caſe ſhall not avoid a Leaſe for years made by him before his Remitter, yet the caſe of a Rent is there alſo agreed that it is determined by the Remitter, and the ſame Law is in Ioynt-tenancy, if one doth make a Leaſe for years, ſo that he doth diſpoſe of the poſſeſſion, this ſhall bind the Survivor, but otherwiſe if he charges the Land with a Rent or other thing, and ſo is it where a husband hath a term in right of his wife, as in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 9. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt part of the Caſe ſo: If the Fine levied by <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:54307:55"/> the Son and Heir of Sir <hi>Richard Knightley</hi> doth give any force or ſtrength to the confirmation, or not, and I conceive that it doth not for three cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Fine is not with any Proclamations, ſo that it is no bar to the Intail, and therefore it is no more then a bare Grant of a Tenant in Tail.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As this Fine is found, it cannot be intended to be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> the Son of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> but by a ſtranger of that name: for it is firſt found, that the 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard</hi> did grant the Advowſon to <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> then his Son and Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and that the 36 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a Fine was levied between <hi>B. T.</hi> and <hi>H. Y.</hi> Plaintiffs, and <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> Eſquire Deforceator, wihout ſaying <hi>(the aforeſaid)</hi> and therefore I conceive, that <hi>Valentine Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Eſquire, who levied the Fine, cannot be intended to be <hi>Valentine Knightley</hi> Son and Heir of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and yet I agree the Caſe of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. That when <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is put into a Plea, and then a matter is alledged <hi>apud Weſtmonaſterium,</hi> without <hi>(praedict.)</hi> it ſhall be intended the ſame place, but when another addition is given to the perſon or place, it is otherwiſe, and therefore in the ſecond place if it be ſayd <hi>apud Weſtmonaſterium ſuper Thameſin,</hi> it ſhall not be taken for one place, 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer.</hi>

               <p>IN an Ejectment, the Caſe was this. <hi>A Biſhop makes a Leaſe of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to <hi>I.S.</hi> for 21. years, and dies, the Succeſſor before the Statute 1 Eliz makes a Leaſe of this to <hi>I.

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this ſecond Leaſe be ended or not, is the Queſtion?</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the Leaſe ſhall begin from the <hi>20</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and ſo it is ended before the Leaſe made to <hi>I. S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the argument of which caſe, the true ſence and meaning of this ill pen'd <hi>Habendum</hi> is to be conſidered, for thereupon all the difficulty of this caſe doth depend: and as to that I conceive there are but four
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54307:56"/> ways to expound this <hi>Habendum:</hi> and if it be taken in any of theſe conſtructions, this Leaſe ſhall begin by computation from the <hi>20</hi> of <hi>December, 1 Elizab.</hi> and ſo ſhall end the <hi>20</hi> of <hi>December, 12 Jacob.</hi> which is before the Leaſe made to the Leſſor of the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>And the firſt way is to obſerve the firſt part of the <hi>Habendum, (ſcil.)</hi> from the <hi>20</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> then next following, to be onely material and good; and the laſt part, being repugnant thereto, is voyd.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is to take the firſt words of the limitation of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the Eſtate to be voyd, and the laſt words <hi>(ſcil.) next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the determination and end of the term of I. S.</hi> &amp;c. to be good.</p>
               <p>The third way is to conſtrue as well the firſt as the laſt words of the Commencement to be voyd, by reaſon of the direct repugnancy in them.</p>
               <p>And the fourth and laſt conſtruction is, to make ſuch conſtruction, as all theſe words by a reaſonable expoſition may agree together.</p>
               <p>And according to any three of theſe conſtructions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the firſt, the third, or the fourth, it is apparent, that the Leaſe to <hi>I. N.</hi> under whom the Defendant claims, did end the <hi>20</hi> of <hi>December, 12 Jacob.</hi> which was before the entry of <hi>Anthony Rudd</hi> the laſt Biſhop, and the Leaſe made to the Leſſor of the Plaintiff, and then this Leaſe is good: and therefore my endeavor is to prove, that this <hi>Habendum</hi> ought to be taken in any of theſe three ways, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt, third, or fourth, and to diſprove that it cannot be taken in the ſecond way.</p>
               <p>For the argument whereof, I ſhall ſpeak to the firſt and ſecond to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for that that I will ſpeak of the firſt, will be a manifeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>And as to this, I conceive that it is a Rule infallible in the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Deeds, that when two clauſes are contained in a Deed, the one contradicting the other, the firſt ſhall be good, and the laſt voyd. <hi>2 Ed. 2. Feoffments</hi> and <hi>Deeds 94.</hi> One gave Land to <hi>R.</hi> with <hi>A.</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Frank-marriage, <hi>habendum</hi> to <hi>R.</hi> and his Heirs, with warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him and his Heirs, they dyed, and their Son brought a <hi>Mortdan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor:</hi> and becauſe the firſt clauſe was in Frank-marriage, and the other in Fee, the Iuſtices doubted to which of them they ſhould have regard: and at laſt adjudged, that when there were ſeveral or two clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in a Deed repugnant, or of divers natures, that more regard ought to be taken to the firſt, then to the laſt. But otherwiſe in Wills, for there the laſt part of a Will ſhall controul the firſt; as if one firſt doth deviſe Land to <hi>A.</hi> and after deviſe this to another, and it is to both in fee, yet the laſt deviſe ſhall ſtand. <hi>19 Ed. 3. Tayl 1.</hi> In a Writ of <hi>Ad Terminum qui praeteriit,</hi> the Tenant pleaded a Gift in Frank-marriage to his Father and Mother by Deed, which was thus, that is to ſay, <hi>habendum</hi> to them for their lives, and reſolved, that the Gift in Frank-marriage being firſt, that it is good, and the <hi>Habendum</hi> being contrary, is voyd: and there the ſame rule is given, where two clauſes are contained in a Deed, and the one is contrary to the other.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Tracy</hi> and <hi>Throgmortons</hi> Caſe, <hi>Comment. 153.</hi> It is a ground in Law, that if the <hi>Habendum</hi> in a Deed be contrary to the Eſtate given by the premiſſes, the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall be voyd: as if a Grant be made to one and to his Heirs, <hi>Habendum</hi> for life, the <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> is voyd. <hi>13 H. 7. 23.</hi> and <hi>24.</hi> and <hi>Dyer 272.</hi> A Termor does grant his term to another, <hi>Habendum</hi> after the death of the Grantor, adjudged that the <hi>Habendum</hi> is voyd. And <hi>2 Ed. 4.</hi> If one releaſe all his right in <hi>B.</hi> acre, which he purchaſed of <hi>I. S.</hi> and in truth he did not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54307:57"/> purchaſe it of <hi>I. S.</hi> but of another, or elſe had it by deſcent, yet is the releaſe good, for the firſt clauſe ſhall ſtand, and the other ſhall be voyd. And <hi>Dyer 292. b.</hi> One having a Cloſe called <hi>Callis,</hi> lying in <hi>Hurſt</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> does make a Leaſe of his Cloſe called <hi>Callis</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> and adjudged that it ſhall paſs, for the firſt words ſhall be, and the other ſhall be voyd. And <hi>Dyer 32 H. 847. 6.</hi> a Leaſe was made for life without impeachment of waſte, and if it happen him to make waſte, that then it ſhall be lawful for the Leſſor to enter. <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> conceived there, that the condition was voyd, becauſe it was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the former Grant; but ſome conceived, that the Grant ſhall be intended, that he ſhall not be puniſhed by action. Whereupon I collect, that if the condition in the laſt clauſe cannot agree with the firſt, the laſt is voyd: and ſo <hi>Dyer 56. 6.</hi> If I releaſe to <hi>A.</hi> all actions which <hi>I. S.</hi> hath againſt him, the Releaſe is good; and the words <hi>(viz.)</hi> which <hi>I. S.</hi> hath againſt him, are voyd: for by words ſubſequent, a Deed may be qualified and abridged, but not deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>And as to the third manner of expoſition <hi>(viz.)</hi> to conſtrue all the words of the limitation, as well the firſt as the laſt, to be voyd. There is a Rule in Law, that when words in a Deed, Plea, or Record, are ſo repugnant, that the true ſence thereof cannot be known to the Court, what is to be judged or conſtrued upon them, that all ſhall be taken to be voyd, as appears by divers Books: <hi>33 H. 6. 26.</hi> In an action on the Caſe, wherein the Writ was, that whereas the Plaintiff had a way by reaſon of his tenure, the Defendant had levyed a Wall, whereby his way was ſtopped; and there <hi>Priſot</hi> ſaid, that the Writ was not good for the repugnancy: and <hi>9 H. 7. 3. a.</hi> One pleaded <hi>Null tiel Record &amp; hoc paratus eſt verificare per idem Recordum;</hi> this was adjudged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, becauſe the Plea is repugnant, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt part which is not a Record, and the laſt that there is ſuch a Record: and <hi>Dyer 70. 5 Edw. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo here, if theſe two limitations in the begining of this Leaſe are ſo repugnant one to the other, that they cannot conſiſt together, then both ſhall be adjudged voyd: and then there being no certain time put for the beginning of the Leaſe, the Leaſe ſhall begin preſently; as in <hi>3 Ed. 6. 6.</hi> A man made a Leaſe for years to commence after the end of a Leaſe made to <hi>I. S.</hi> and in truth <hi>I. S.</hi> had no Leaſe, the Leaſe ſhall begin preſently.</p>
               <p>And as to the fourth manner of expoſition, I conceive that theſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words ſhall be conſtrued <hi>[if it may be]</hi> that all may be good as to a reaſonable expoſition: and that is, that the <hi>56</hi> years ſhall begin from the <hi>20 Decemb. 1 Eliz.</hi> but the Leaſe does not take effect in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion until the end of the other Leaſe; for <hi>terminus annorum</hi> hath two ſignifications, <hi>ſcil.</hi> one the time or number of the years, and the other the Eſtate or intereſt of the term; and therefore if one does grant his term, the Eſtate does paſs thereby: and this diverſity is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and explained the <hi>35 H. 8. 6.</hi> and in <hi>Cooks 1 Rep. Cheddingtons</hi> Caſe. So that I conceive that the firſt words in the <hi>Habendum</hi> here ought to be applyed and referred to the time or number of years, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt definition of the term; and the laſt ſhall be applyed to the laſt definition, and ſhall be taken onely as words explanatory put in for better caution by the Biſhop to avoyd contention between the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, <hi>viz.</hi> That the laſt Leſſee ſhall not meddle with the poſſeſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end of the firſt term: and by this conſtruction, and no other, may all the words agree together: <hi>Dyer 9 Eliz. 261. 6. Abbot</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54307:57"/> 
                  <hi>Covent</hi> did make two Leaſes of two parcels of Land to two perſons, <hi>1531.</hi> for <hi>31</hi> years, and after the ſucceſſor <hi>1535.</hi> reciting both the Leaſes, did make a new Leaſe to the other in theſe words: <hi>Noveritis nos praedict. Abb. &amp;c. dictis 31 annis finitis &amp; complet conceſſiſe</hi> to the Leſſee the ſaid Land, holden from the day of the making of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>(termin. praedict. finitis)</hi> until the end and term of <hi>31</hi> years from thence next following. And the Iuſtices of the Common Bench held, that it ſhall commence to take effect in poſſeſſion at the end of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer term, and not before: and <hi>[from the day of the making of theſe preſents]</hi> is but a declaring of the firſt ſentence, which is obſcure to ſome intents; and if it were not ſo expreſt, the Leſſee ſhall have but a Leaſe for four years, which was not the intent of the parties, as it ſhould ſeem; but the Court of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> was on the contrary: But afterwards the caſe was reſolved upon another point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Leaſe was voyd, becauſe that the words <hi>[a die confectionis, &amp;c.]</hi> were razed by the Leſſee himſelf. But admitting that in this caſe the Leaſe ſhould not begin until the end of the firſt Leaſe, yet that is no proof, that in our caſe the Leaſe ſhall not begin preſently: for in this caſe of the <hi>9</hi> of <hi>Elizab.</hi> the true Grant in the premiſſes does ſhew the intent of the parties to make a Leaſe in Reverſion, and that ſhall controul the words in the <hi>Habendum [a die confectionis:]</hi> alſo theſe words are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by other words in the <hi>Habendum, viz. termino praedict finito.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the former Leaſe is recited as a good Leaſe without doubt, but in our caſe the firſt Leaſe is not received as a Leaſe in truth, but is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pretended Leaſe: and yet in this caſe there were diverſities of Opinions, if the Leaſe ſhall commence preſently or not. And <hi>Mich. 10 Jacob. Thomas Moor</hi> brought an Ejectment againſt <hi>John Muſgrave</hi> upon a Leaſe made to him by <hi>William Moor</hi> the fifth of <hi>May, 10 Jac.</hi> of a Meſſuage, &amp;c. in <hi>C.</hi> in the County of <hi>Cumberland, habendum</hi> from the Feaſt of the <hi>Anunciation</hi> laſt paſt for <hi>21</hi> years, whereby he entred and was poſſeſt until the Defendant the ſame day did eject him: To which the Defendant pleaded Not guilty. And the Iury found, that <hi>William Moor</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee, and made a Leaſe to the Plaintiff, <hi>habendum</hi> from the <hi>Anunciation</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> laſt paſt, for the term of <hi>21</hi> years next enſuing the date hereof, &amp;c. And Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, whereby it appears that the term ſhall begin from the firſt limitation.</p>
               <p>And after the Caſe was argued on the Bench by all the Iudges,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> and <hi>Denham, Bromley,</hi> and <hi>Tanfield</hi> were of Opinion for the Defendant: wherefore Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>IN an Ejectment on a Leaſe made by <hi>George Walker</hi> Parſon of the pariſh of S. <hi>John Evangeliſt</hi> in <hi>London, 14 Junii, 14 Jac.</hi> of a Meſſuage called the <hi>Swan</hi> in the ſaid Pariſh, <hi>habendum</hi> from the <hi>Anunciation</hi> laſt paſt for three years, whereupon the Plaintiff was poſſeſt, until he was ejected by the Defendant the <hi>15 Junii</hi> in the ſame year: And upon Not guilty pleaded, the Iury found,</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Meſſuage did lie within the City of <hi>London,</hi> and that it was an ancient City, and that by the Cuſtom every Citizen being a Freeman of <hi>London,</hi> by his Will in writing may deviſe all his houſes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54307:58"/> and Lands, and any part thereof in the ſaid City, as well in <hi>Mortmain</hi> without licenſe, as in any other manner in Fee, in Tayl, for life, or for years, &amp;c. and that the ſaid Cuſtom, and all other Cuſtoms of the ſaid City, the <hi>7</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond were confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And they found that <hi>William Daringre,</hi> Citizen and Freeman of <hi>London,</hi> the tenth of <hi>May, 34</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, was ſeiſed in Fee, as well of the ſaid Meſſuages, as of other Lands in <hi>London</hi> in Fee; and the tenth of <hi>May, 1360.</hi> and in the <hi>34</hi> of <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> made his Will in writing, and thereby did deviſe the ſaid Meſſuages by the name of his Tenements in theſe words following. And firſt he deviſed a Quit Rent of <hi>40 s.</hi> a year to the Parſon of St. <hi>John Evangeliſt,</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, to pray for Souls: and he did deviſe to the ſaid Parſon and his ſucceſſors, a Chamber with two Cellars thereupon lying on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his Tenement, to pray for Souls: And then followed this clauſe: <hi>Item, lego &amp; ordino quod unus capellanus celebret in Eccleſia Sancti Johannis praedict. ſtatim poſt deceſſum meum, pro anima mea &amp; animabus praedictis, &amp; quod idem capellanus percipiet annuatim de Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemento meo 8</hi> Marks <hi>pro ſtipendio; &amp; volo quod idem capellanus ad matutinas miſſas &amp; omnibus aliis horis Canonicis in Eccleſia praedict. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſit per diſpoſitionem Rectoris ejuſdem qui pro tempore fuerit, &amp; de reſiduo ſi quod clarum fuerit ultra ſolutionem dict. tenementi.

               </p>
               <p>And the Deviſor dyed the ſame day ſeiſed of the ſaid Tenements.</p>
               <p>And they further found, that the Meſſuages wherein, &amp;c. is parcel of one of the Tenements in the Will, out of which the Teſtator did ordain, that the ſaid Chaplain ſhould have eight Marks for his ſtipend, and that <hi>Henry Tyting</hi> was Parſon of the ſaid Church at the time of the death of the Deviſor, and that the Church was voyd by his death, and that the Leſſor was preſented, admitted, inſtituted and inducted: and that he entered into the ſaid Meſſuages upon the Defendant, and did expel him, and made the Leaſe to the Plaintiff, who entered and was poſſeſt until the Defendant ejected him. And whether the Defendant was guilty or not, they prayed the Opinion of the Court.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgment.</p>
               <p>And the Queſtion is, Whether the Parſon by this Deviſe ſhall have the houſes, the ſaid eight Marks are limited to be payd to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain or not? And I conceive that the Parſon ſhall have it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Comment. 4136.</hi> It is taken for a Rule, that in expounding
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54307:58"/> of Wills, the Law ſhall interpret the words of the Deviſor, and ſhall direct their operation according to the intent of the Deviſor: ſo that to the matter, form, and order limited in laſt Wills, the Law does ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, and wills that they ſhould be obſerved. And although that in Conveyances or Deeds executed by men in their life-times, the Law doth require apt words to make Eſtates, yet in Wills the intent of the Deviſor is ſufficient, either to limit the Eſtate, or to deſcribe the perſon that ſhall have it.</p>
               <p>And therefore if Land be given to one <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> if it be by Grant or Feoffment, yet there paſſeth but an Eſtate for life; but if it be given by Will, it is an Eſtate in Fee: and <hi>4 Ed. 6. Eſtates 78.</hi> If one deviſeth his Land to another, paying <hi>10 l.</hi> to his Executors or any other perſon, the Deviſee hath an Eſtate in Fee: ſo if one deviſeth his Land to give or diſpoſe of, or ſell at his will, this is a Fee-ſimple. <hi>19 H. 8. 96. 7 Ed. 6. Deviſe 38.</hi> And the reaſon in all theſe caſes is, becauſe that by theſe words the intent of the Deviſor doth appear that a Fee ſhall paſs, and therefore the defect of words ſhall not defeat his intent. And as the intent is ſufficient without apt words to make an Eſtate, ſo is it alſo to deſcribe the perſon who ſhall take the Deviſe, although he be not formally named according to the preciſe rule in Grants: as in <hi>21 R. 2. Deviſe 17.</hi> where one deviſed Land to one for life, the remainder to another for life, the remainder to the Church of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Holborn:</hi> and it was adjudged, that after the death of the Deviſees for life, the Parſon of the Church ſhall have the Land, for in as much as the Church was not capable, it ſhall be taken, that the intent of the Deviſor was, that the Parſon, who is as it were the Father of the Church, and ſo the Head of it, ſhould have the Eſtate. And in the <hi>13 H. 7. 17.</hi> In every Deviſe the intent of the Deviſor ſhall be taken: for if a man deviſeth all his goods to his Wife, and that after his deceaſe his Son and Heir ſhall have his Houſe, although that no Deviſe of the Houſe be made to the Wife by expreſs words, but by implication, becauſe the Heir is not to have the Houſe during the Wifes life, yet becauſe the intent of the Deviſor was, that the Son ſhould not have it during the life of his Wife, ſhe ſhall have the Houſe for her life: To which all agreed.</p>
               <p>Then in our caſe, <hi>1.</hi> The Deviſor willeth, that a Chaplain ſhall celebrate for his Soul, and that he ſhall have eight Marks out of his Tenements yearly for his ſtipend, but if he had ſtayed there, the Deviſe ſhould have been voyd, for the Chaplain is not ſuch a perſon as may take theſe eight Marks as a Rent: and therefore he goes further, and firſt he limits what ſervice the Preiſt ſhall do, and this he appoints to be done by the diſpoſition of the Parſon.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> He doth diſpoſe of the reſidue of the profits of the Tenement for ſuch a time, <hi>(viz.) until R. ſhall be 24 years of age, and be a Prieſt;</hi> and doth deviſe, that he ſhall be preferred to the Chantery before any other, if he will accept it, and if not, that he ſhall have nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> He makes proviſion for the perpetual continuance of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, in theſe words, <hi>(ſcil.) That the Parſon and four of the beſt of the Pariſhioners ſhall preſent and finde a Chaplain to perform the ſaid Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery for ever, <hi>de tenementis meis ſuperius non legat.</hi>
                  </hi> which is the ſaid Tenement out of which the ſaid eight Marks are limited to be payd.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> He doth inflict a penalty upon the Parſon, if the Chantery ſhould be voyd, <hi>(ſcil.) That the other Land deviſed by him to the Parſon, ſhall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54307:59"/> go to the Wardens of</hi> L. <hi>Bridg, for the reparation thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> He makes a perpetual diſpoſition for the reſidue of the profits of the Tenement, <hi>(viz.) That they ſhall be put into a Cheſt under the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of the Parſon and four of the Pariſhioners, to buy ornaments and Books for the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe parts of the Will being well conſidered (as I conceive) it will be clear, that the intent of the Deviſor was, that the Parſon ſhould have this Tenement; for here the main ſcope of his Will is, that a Chaplain ſhall be maintained perpetually, and that he ſhall have eight Marks ſtipend out of that Tenement, and that it ſhall be provided and found by the Parſon and four of the Pariſhioners, and that the reſidue of the profits ſhall be beſtowed by them to buy orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Books for the Church: ſo that a perpetual charge is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Parſon, <hi>(ſcil.) to finde the Prieſt, and to buy orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> and this charge is to be defrayed with the profits of the Tenement, and that can be done by none but by him that ſhall be owner of the Tenement: and therefore it follows that the Parſon ſhall have the Tenement.</p>
               <p>And that ſuch implication in a Will is ſufficient to make an Eſtate, is proved by the <hi>15 H. 7. 126.</hi> If one deviſes his Land to be ſold for payment of his Debts, the Executor ſhall ſell the Land, for becauſe the charge to pay Debts lies upon the Executors, his intent ſhall be taken to have them ſell the Land: and <hi>22</hi> and <hi>23 Elizab. Dyer 171.</hi> A man ſeiſed in Fee of divers Mannors, doth deviſe them to his Siſter in Fee (<hi>except my Mannor of</hi> D. <hi>which I do appoint to pay my Debts</hi>) and makes two Executors, and dyes; and one Executor dyes, and the other ſells th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Mannor, and adjudged good, for ſo his intent ſhall be taken, and not to relinquiſh it to his Siſter: and <hi>19 H. 6. 24</hi> and <hi>25.</hi> and <hi>1 Edw. 6. Deviſe 36.</hi> If one deviſe that his Executor ſhall ſell his Land, this is no deviſe of the Land to them, but an authority; for they may perform the Deviſor to ſell the Land, although they have no Eſtate therein, and the Vendee ſhall be in by the Deviſor: but if one deviſe that his Executors ſhall grant a Rent-charge out of his Land, or that they ſhall give the Land in Fee or in Tayl to <hi>I. S.</hi> this is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Deviſe to them, for otherwiſe they cannot perform the intent of the Deviſor. <hi>Trin. 9 Eliz. 516.</hi> and ſo in the <hi>40 Aſſiſ. 26.</hi> One did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe his Land in <hi>L.</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs to finde twelve Marks for two Chaplains, and grants that the Parſon and the Pariſh may diſtrein for this if it be behinde: and there it is debated whether the King ſhall have the twelve Marks or not? and it is agreed there, that the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains have no Eſtate in it, becauſe they are removable at the will of <hi>A.</hi> but becauſe the Diſtreſs is given to the Parſon who is perpetual, it was adjudged that the King ſhall have the twelve Marks: whereupon I do obſerve, that by this Diſtreſs limited to the Parſon and the Pariſhioners, the twelve Marks were veſted as a Rent in the Parſon, and ſo made it a <hi>Mortmain.</hi>
               </p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> But it may be objected, That the laſt clauſe in the Will for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the reſidue of the profits, does go onely to the Land deviſed to Wardens of the Bridg.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> But this cannot be: Firſt, becauſe that the Land deviſed to them, is onely a Chamber, and a manſion of little value, and that is to repair the Bridg; and that is a work of ſuch charge, that no ſurpluſſage can be intended. Secondly, The clauſe is, <hi>Id quod clarum fuerit ultra ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem &amp; reparationem, &amp;c.</hi> which are the very words in the clauſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54307:59"/> uſed for the diſpoſing of the reſidue to <hi>R.</hi> for the time, and cannot be referred to the Deviſe of the Wardens of the Bridge, becauſe that the things deviſed to them are apparently to be for the reparation only, and no payment is limited out of it, but the Tenement out of which the Stipend is to be payd, is firſt charged with this payment, and then with the reparation of the Tenement, and then with the Ornaments and Books for the Church.</p>
               <p>And afterwards this Caſe was argued by <hi>Coventrey</hi> the Kings Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor for the Plaintiff, and by S. <hi>Chibborne</hi> for the Defendant. And <hi>Mich. 16. Jac.</hi> The Barons <hi>(viz.)

               <p>And although this Grant of the Reverſion be but for years, yet is it all one, for the diverſity is between a Leaſe for years, made Tenant in Fee or for life to commence in future, and a grant of a Reverſion, for in the firſt Caſe it is but a future Charge upon the Land, ſo that the Leſſor hath his former Eſtate untill the Leaſe doth begin, and the Leſſee hath no Term but only <hi>intereſſe termin.</hi> and therefore <hi>Hil.</hi> 38. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi> in the Common Pleas, between <hi>Row</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> it was agreed, that if the Leſſor be diſſeiſed before the Leaſe begins, the Leſſee after the day of the Commencement may grant the term, otherwiſe where a Leſſee for yeares in poſſeſſion is outed by an eſtranger, for there his Term is turned into a Right, but in the firſt Caſe he hath not any Term in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and therefore it cannot be turned into a Right, nor any wrong done thereunto.</p>
               <p>And for direct Authorities in this Caſe, 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Common Pleas, the Counteſſe of <hi>Kents</hi> Caſe; Where one having a Reverſion in Fee does grant this, <hi>Habendum</hi> after the death of <hi>I.

And in the <hi>Comment.</hi> 155. by <hi>Brown,</hi> If one having a Reverſion does grant it <hi>habendum</hi> after a day to come for years, this is a void Grant, for if it may be granted from a day to come, the Grantor ſhall have a particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in the mean time by his own making, which cannot be, that one may be Leſſor to himſelf, or diminiſh his own Eſtate, and there it is taken for a Rule, that when there is a Rent in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> or a Reverſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a man cannot make this to be in <hi>eſſe</hi> for a time, and to ceaſe for another time, or to grant it to another after the death of any, or from a day to come, relinquiſhing to himſelf an Eſtate in the mean time: And in the <hi>Comment.</hi> 197. <hi>b. Adams</hi> againſt <hi>Wortesbey,</hi> agreed there, that a Reverſion cannot paſſe as a Reverſion, according to the common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thereof from a day to come.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Haughton</hi> conceived, that this Caſe being a bargain and ſale whereby the uſe doth paſſe firſt, this may well paſſe from a day to come. <hi>Quod nullus dedixit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is not averred that the twenty acres in which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe was taken, was not part of the Cloſes excepted, ſo that it may be part of them, and then no Diſtreſſe for the Rent can be taken there.</p>
               <p>And although it may be gathered by ſome words in the Bar to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry, that the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was parcell of the Land deviſed to <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> yet this ſhall not help the Conuſans, as in <hi>Cokes</hi> 7. <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 24, <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. where one having Land in Fee, and another Land for years, did grant a Rent for life out of both, the Grantee diſtrained for the Rent, and avowed that the Rent was granted out of the Leaſe land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other lands, whereas he ought to have alledged the Rent to be granted out of the Land in Fee only, and although the Plaintiff in his Bar to the Avowry hath ſhewed the truth of the Caſe, yet this will not make the Avowry which wants ſubſtance to be good.</p>

               <p>For all the Iuſtices did agree, that the ſaid Fine was to the uſe of the Plaintiff, and his Heirs, whereupon the Defendant brought this Writ of Error, and aſſigned the Error in the point of Iudgment only.</p>
               <p>And it was objected by the Councell of the Plaintiffs in the Writ of Error that, that it was apparent upon this aſſurance, that it was made for the aſſurance of the payment of ſeven hundred pounds lent by the Plaintiff to Sir <hi>William,</hi> and Sir <hi>William</hi> was to repay nine hundred forty three pounds which was full Intereſt, according to the rate of ten in the hundred, and then by the expreſſe Covenant in the firſt Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Defendant in the Writ of Error was to have the Rents and Profits of the Land alſo, whereby <hi>Worfeild</hi> ſhould have more then ten pounds in the hundred, and then the aſſurance is void by the Statute of Vſury, then, although by the laſt Indenture it is provided that Sir <hi>William</hi> and his wife ſhould have the Rents and Profits, untill the day of payment, yet this ſhall not bind the wife, for it is found expreſly that ſhe did diſagree to this Indenture.</p>
               <p>But I conceive that the Diſtreſſe was not well taken, but that the Fine was to the uſe of <hi>William Worfeild</hi> and his heirs, and ſo the Rent belonged to him.</p>
               <p>And firſt as to the Objection, that the aſſurance is void by reaſon of the Statute of Vſury; that cannot be.</p>

               <p>For the Licenſe is not purſued, for it is to keep a Tavern in the Manſion Houſe, in which the three parties did then inhabit, or ſhould after inhabit, whereby the King hath reſtrained this liberty to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place; and the Defendant doth juſtifie under the Licenſe of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas King,</hi> or his Aſſignee, to keep a Tavern in his Manſion Houſe, which is not warranted by the Kings Licenſe.

               <p>And this matter is enforced by the preamble of the Statute of the <hi>7 Edw. 6.</hi> and the fifth, which is, <hi>For the avoyding of many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, much evil rule and reſort of diſordered perſons to many Taverns newly ſet up, in very great number, in Back-Lanes and ſuſpicious places within <hi>London,</hi> and otherwhere:</hi> whereby it is to be preſumed, that the King did take notice of the Houſe in which the parties did then inhabit, to be a fit place, and he truſted all of them, but would not truſt any one of them.</p>

               <p>The Defendant hath not anſwered to the greateſt part of the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> contained in the Information, for the Information is from the firſt of <hi>Novemb. 13 Jac.</hi> and a hundred other days between the firſt of <hi>Novem. 13 Jac.</hi> and the <hi>26 Octob. 14 Jac.</hi> and then the Defendant pleads not guilty the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> and all the other days between the firſt of <hi>November</hi> and the <hi>26 Octob.</hi> ſaving fourty of the ſaid days, and for the fourty days he juſtifies by vertue of a Licenſe the laſt of <hi>Auguſt. 14 Jac.</hi> ſo that it may be that the fourty days that the Information men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were before this time, for he hath the benefit of all days between the firſt of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and the <hi>26 Octob.</hi> and the Not guilty at the firſt of <hi>November</hi> and an hundred days between that and the <hi>26 October,</hi> and the fourty days excepted in the <hi>[Not guilty]</hi> may be as well before the laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> as afterwards; and it is at the election of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to charge the Defendant with fourty days, at what time he will between the firſt of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and <hi>26</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> As in a Treſpaſs for breaking a Cloſe, the Plaintiff may after upon a new aſſignment, or in evidence upon Not guilty pleaded, aſſign the Treſpaſs in what Land he will within the ſame Town, although he hath many Cloſes there: and therefore in this caſe, the Defendant ought to have pleaded Not guilty for all the days, until the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and then to have juſtified by his Licenſe.

And the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did covenant, that until manifeſt default was made in the premiſſes, and the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhall be thereof damnified, and upon reaſonable requeſt no ſatisfaction ſhall be given to her, ſhe will not take any advantage by reaſon of the ſaid Obligation, nor will proſecute any Suit againſt the Defendant or any other bound in the ſaid Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the Defendants ſaid, that the Plaintiffs, nor any of them, was not damnified by reaſon of the ſaid Obligation in the Declaration, or by reaſon of any of the ſaid other Obligations; and did aver the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54307:64"/> ſaid Obligation in the Declaration, and the ſaid Obligation of 120 <hi>l.</hi> in the Indenture, to be all one; and that the ſaid ſeveral days of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment limited by the Indenture, nor any of them at the time of the Writ purchaſed, were incurred.</p>
               <p>Vpon which Plea the Plaintiffs demurred, and the Defendant did joyn.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given for the Plaintiffs, for the Plea is utterly inſufficient for divers cauſes. And yet I do agree, that although the Obligation be upon a condition, yet is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture a Defeaſance thereof; ſo that it is ſufficient to the Defendant to perform the one or the other. But the Indenture is of two parts: 1. That if the Defendant ſhall pay to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the daughter 500 <hi>l.</hi> and ſhall perform the other things mentioned in the Plea, that all the Obligations ſhall be voyd and delivered up. 2. The Plaintiff <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> did covenant, that until the Defendant ſhould make default in the premiſſes, and ſhe ſhould be damnified, and upon requeſt no ſatisfaction given to her, ſhe ſhould not take any advantage of the Obligation, nor ſhall proſecute any Suit againſt the Defendant or any other bound in the ſaid Obligation.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt part, I do agree that this is a good defeaſance of the Obligation, but the laſt clauſe is onely a Covenant, and cannot be pleaded in bar of this Action brought upon this Obligation: as in the 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>John de Puſetoes</hi> Caſe: The ſaid <hi>John</hi> and others were bound to <hi>T.</hi> who by Deed did grant to the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> that he ſhould be quite diſcharged of the duty, and if he be vexed or ſued, that the Bond ſhall be voyd, which Caſe is there very largely argued: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the better Opinion to be, that the Bond is diſcharged, becauſe that the words are in effect as the words in the firſt part of this Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>(ſcil.) That if ſuch act be made, the Obligation ſhall be voyd.</hi> But there <hi>Fineux</hi> ſaid, That if I grant to my Tenant for life, that he ſhall not be impeachable for waſte, he ſhall not plead this in Bar, but ſhall have an Action of Covenant thereupon. And <hi>Brudnell</hi> put this caſe, That if I grant to one againſt whom I have cauſe of Action, that I will not ſue him within a year, this is not any ſuſpenſion of the Action: Vpon which caſe it is to be obſerved, that I may ſue, and the other is put to his Action of Covenant.</p>
               <p>And the Plea is firſt inſufficient, becauſe he pleads that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nor any of them, were damnified by reaſon of the Bond in the Declaration, or by reaſon of any of the aforeſaid Writings obligatory in the ſaid Indenture ſpecified: but he does not anſwer to the damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by reaſon of the 500 <hi>l.</hi> to be payd to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the daughter, which is the principal matter to be done by the Defendant for the defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and in truth this Portion was due, and not payd before this Suit begun.</p>
               <p>The Defendant did aver, that the ſeveral days of payment limited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by the Indenture are not incurred, and there is not any day limited for the payment of 500 <hi>l.</hi> and the truth was, that it is payable at the time of the marriage of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the daughter, but this is not limited by the Indenture, nor any time for the payment thereof, and therefore this a verment is not good.</p>
               <p>The Indenture of the Defeaſance is, if the Defendant ſhall pay the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 500 <hi>l.</hi> or procure to the Plaintiff <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſufficent diſcharge for the ſame, and ſhall provide fit maintenance for <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the daughter: Whereupon I conceive that the Defendant ought to pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54307:65"/> provide maintenance for the daughter, or otherwiſe that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a diſcharge from the Plaintiff <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſhall alſo provide maintenance for the daughter, for her maintenance is as neceſſary, if the mony be payd, as it will be, if the diſcharge be procured.

                  <hi>RIchard Parker,</hi> as well for the King as himſelf, did inform againſt Sir <hi>John Webb</hi> and <hi>Katherin</hi> his wife, the which <hi>Katherin</hi> the 18 of <hi>May,</hi> 13 <hi>Jacob.</hi> was eighteen years of age and above, and was Wife of the ſaid Sir <hi>John;</hi> the which ſaid <hi>Katherin</hi> the ſaid 18 of <hi>May,</hi> and always after until now, being an Inhabitant at <hi>North-Charford</hi> in the County of <hi>Southampton</hi> from the ſaid 18 of <hi>May</hi> until the 18 of <hi>May,</hi> 14 <hi>Jacob. viz.</hi> for the ſpace of twelve months, did not come to the aforeſaid Pariſh Church, nor to any other Church, Chappel, or uſual place of Common Prayer, and did not there remain at the time of Common Prayer and Divine Service; but for all the ſaid time did voluntarily and obſtinately, without any reaſonable cauſe, abſtain from the ſame, contrary to the form of the Statute, whereby an Action accrued to the King and the Informer, to have of the ſaid Sir <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Katherin</hi> 240 <hi>l.

               <p>The Defendants ſaid, that the ſaid Statute was made the 16 of <hi>Jan.</hi> 23 of <hi>Elizab.</hi> and that after the making thereof, <hi>viz</hi> in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment held the 29 <hi>Octob.</hi> 28 <hi>Elizab.</hi> it was enacted, That every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, in not repairing to Divine Service contrary to the Statute of the 23 of <hi>Elizab.</hi> who thereupon ſhall happen to be convicted, ſhall pay into the receit of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> according to the rate of 20 <hi>l.</hi> for every month, which ſhall be contained in the Indictment whereupon ſuch conviction was had, and alſo for every month after ſuch conviction, without any other Indictment or Conviction, ſhall pay into the ſaid <hi>Exchequer,</hi> at <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> ſo much as ſhall then remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payd, according to the rate of 50 <hi>l.</hi> for every month after ſuch convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if default ſhall be made in any ſuch payment, that the Queen may by Proces out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> take, ſeiſe, and enjoy all the goods, and two parts as well of the Lands, Tenements, and Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments, Leaſes and Farms of ſuch Offendor, as of all other Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments liable to ſuch ſeiſures or penalties, leaving a third part onely of the ſaid Lands, Leaſes and Farms, for the relief of ſuch Offendor, his Wife, Children, and Family. And, for the more ſpeedy conviction of ſuch Offendors, it was enacted, That upon the Indictment of ſuch Offendor, proclamation ſhall be made at the Aſſiſes, or Gaol-delivery, where ſuch Indictment ſhall be made, whereby it ſhall be commanded that the body of ſuch Offendor ſhall be rendered to the Sheriff of the ſame County before the next Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery, and if ſuch Offender does not appear at the ſaid next Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery, that then upon ſuch default recorded, the ſame ſhall be ſufficient conviction of ſuch Offendor, as if a Tryal by Verdict had been had and recorded.</p>
               <p>And the Defendants further ſaid, that the 19 of <hi>March,</hi> the firſt of King <hi>James,</hi> the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe and Gaol-delivery at the Aſſiſes, and the Iuſtices of Peace at the Quarter Seſſions, have authority to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54307:66"/> enquire and determine of all Recuſants, as well for not receiving the Communion, as for not repairing to Church according to the form of the Lawes, in ſuch manner and form as the Iuſtices of Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery may do, and alſo ſhall have power to make proclamation whereby a Precept ſhall be had for the rendring the body of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Sheriff, before the next Aſſiſes or Gaol-delivery, or the next quarter Seſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they ſaid, that before the Information, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery held at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 8. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> before Sir <hi>Henry Hobard</hi> chief Iuſtice of the Bench, and Sir <hi>Laurence Tanfeild</hi> chief Baron of the Exchequer, Iuſtices of Aſſiſe and Gaol-delivery in the County of <hi>Southampton,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> (by the Oath of <hi>Robert Pawlet</hi> Eſquire, <hi>&amp;c. ſcil.</hi> nineteen in all) which were ſworn and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to enquire for the King and the body of the County) was indicted, for that the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> 11 <hi>Jac.</hi> was of ſixteen years of ago, and did not repair to the Pariſh Church of <hi>Porthchalford,</hi> nor to any other Church, Chappell, or uſuall place of Common Prayer, and was there at the Common Prayer and Divine Service, at any time within one month next enſuing the ſaid firſt of <hi>April,</hi> 11 <hi>Jac.</hi> but did abſtain from the ſame from the ſaid firſt of <hi>April</hi> for amonth, contrary to the form of divers Statutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which Indictment at the ſaid Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery, publick Proclamation was made that the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> ſhould render her body at the next Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery, to render to the King according to the Statute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at which next Aſſiſes and Gaol-delivery, the ſixth of <hi>March,</hi> 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> before the ſaid Iuſtices the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> did not render her body according to the ſaid Proclamation, nor appear upon Record, whereupon the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> of the Premiſſes whereof ſhe was indicted, was lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and yet ſtands convicted according to the Statute: And the Defendants further ſaid, that they the aforeſaid Term of <hi>Eaſter</hi> next after the conviction aforeſaid, the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> did not pay, nor any of them did pay into the Exchequer, according to the rate of twenty pounds for every week contained in the ſaid Indictment, nor did after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in the ſaid Exchequer, ſo much as then did remain not payd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rate of twenty pounds for every month after ſuch convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but thereof made default, which conviction afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Term of S. <hi>Michael</hi> then next after the conviction as aforeſaid, by the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Hubbert</hi> and <hi>Laurence Tanfeild,</hi> Iuſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was extreated and certified into the Exchequer, and ſo there did remain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the Statute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the ſaid conviction yet does remain in full force, and this they are ready to aver, with that alſo that the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> named in the Information, and the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> named in the Indictment, are one and the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>Vpon which Plea Mr. Attorney demurred in Law, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants did joyn.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given for the King, and the Informer againſt the Defendants.</p>
               <p>In which, firſt it is to be conſidered, that neither the Statute of 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> nor the Statute 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which give ſeverall remedies to the King for the monthly forfeiture of twenty pounds given by the 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> doe not reſtrain the Informer, but that notwithſtanding thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, any one may inform againſt any Recuſant, for not repairing to Church, againſt the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> unleſſe the King hath firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his remedie againſt him for the ſame offence, for that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54307:67"/> by all the Court in Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> And as I beleive this will be granted and by the Defendants Councell, ſo I will agree with them, that if the Recuſant be once convicted, and puniſht at the ſuit of the King, he ſhall not be puniſht for the ſame offence again, at the ſuit of the Informer, or otherwiſe, for it is unjuſt to puniſh an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender twice for one Crime.</p>
               <p>And therefore the chief matter to be conſidered in this Caſe, is the nature and force of this conviction againſt the wife, and whether it be ſuch a conviction as will bar the Informer of his Information, or not.</p>
               <p>And as to that, firſt, the woman is indicted here of Recuſancy, and proclaimed according to the Statute of 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and ſhe did not render her body whereby ſhe is convicted by this Statute, but this conviction is not any Iudgment, for the true words of the Statute are, That if the party indicted ſhall not appear, but make default after ſuch Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that then upon ſuch default recorded, this ſhall be a ſufficient conviction in Law of ſuch Offender, as if a Tryall by Verdict had been had and recorded, ſo that ſuch default of appearance is made equivalent to a Verdict by that Statute, but not to a Iudgment, ſo that now it is to be underſtood, that the woman in this Caſe is convicted by Verdict of Recuſancy, but no Iudgment is given. And I conceive that ſuch conviction is no Bar to the Informer.</p>
               <p>For that this is a fruitleſſe conviction and ſuch a one, as the King can take no advantage of, and every conviction that ſhall make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to the perſon convicted, ought to be a legall and abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and ſuch a one as thereby the party convicted may ſuffer the penalty impoſed by the Law for ſuch offence.</p>
               <p>And that the King can have no benefit of this conviction is apparent, for the remedy given to him by the 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for the penalty is to ſeiſe all the Goods, and two parts of the Lands and Leaſes of the Recuſant, but the woman here being married hath no Lands or Goods, and therefore the King cannot have any thing, and the Goods or Lands of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band cannot be taken for his wifes offence, ſhe being convicted by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment only, to which the husband is no party.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> But it may be objected that the wife may perhaps ſurvive the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and then ſhe may have Goods and Lands, and the King may ſeiſe them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that firſt, it may be alſo that the husband may ſurvive, and then the King ſhall never have any thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> as it is reſolved in Dr. <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> Caſe. 2. This Objection is upon two poſſibilities; 1. That the husband may firſt dye. 2. That the wife then ſhall have Lands and Goods: And I have alwaies taken it for a Rule, that a poſſibility ſhall never take away a preſent Action or Suit as is proved by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Caſes, as in 5. <hi>Rep. Hariſons</hi> Caſe, and 9. <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 108. 109.</p>
               <p>And as it is ſaid in <hi>Elmers</hi> Caſe 5. <hi>Rep.</hi> that two poſſibilities cannot maintain hoſpitality or repair a Churche, ſo I ſay in this caſe, that one ſuch poſſibility to recover this penalty for the King, cannot hinder the Informer of his Suit, nor oppoſe the good reformation of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants intended by the Statute, for then all marryed women addicted to Popery will be Recuſants upon confidence, that if they be once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by Indictment (the which they themſelves may procure to be done) then they ſhall not be ſubject to any penalty during the lives of their husbands, who peradventure may ſurvive them, and as it was well obſerved in Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe, that married women are the moſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54307:67"/> dangerous Recuſants, becauſe that they have the education of their Children and the government of their Servants.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that if the Informer may ſue and recover againſt the husband and wife, then if the wife does ſurvive, the King ſhall have theſe Lands, and goods according to the 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> or may ſue the husband and wife, according to the 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for theſe penalties, and ſo ſhall be two waies puniſhed for the ſame offence.</p>
               <p>No ſuch inconvenience can happen, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> for as it is reſolved in Dr. <hi>Foſters</hi> Caſe, the recovery of the Informer being legall ſhall bar the King, as in the 19 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. where the Teſtator was bound in a Recognizance for performing of Covenants, this was no bar in debt upon an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that the Plaintiff may recover, and if after ſuch recovery the Statute be forfeited, and execution thereupon, the Executor ſhall have an <hi>Audita Querela,</hi> for that he had lawfully adminiſtred the goods before for payment of the Bonds.</p>
               <p>And after, <hi>viz. Mich.</hi> 17 <hi>Jac.</hi> I moved the Court that the Plea of the Defendants was inſufficient, for that the Statute did ordain that upon every Indictment of Recuſancy, proclamation ſhould be made, and that the body of the Offender ſhould be rendred to the Sheriff of the County before the next Aſſiſes or Gaol-delivery, and if ſuch Offender ſo proclaimed, does not appear but makes default, that he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Defendants have pleaded, that Proclamation was made, that the body of the ſaid <hi>Katherine</hi> ſhould be rendred at the next Aſſiſes or Gaol-delivery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore ſhe is not convict at all, becauſe ſhe was not proclaimed according to the Statute for this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation differs in two materiall circumſtances from the form pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Statute; firſt, in omiſſion of the Sheriff to whom the body is to be rendred. 2. In the time for the Statute limits it to be done before the next Aſſiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this Proclamation gives a larger time <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> at the Aſſiſes.</p>
               <p>Whereupon all the Court agreed that the Plea was inſufficient for the cauſes aforeſaid, and that now the wife was not convicted by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Iudgment<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> was given for the King and the Informer.</p>

               <p>For that in <hi>Littleton</hi> 118. If one doth releaſe to another all Demands, this is the beſt Releaſe that may be, and ſhall enure to the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him to whom it is made: For by ſuch Releaſe, all Actions, Reals and Perſonals, and Appeals and Executions, are gone and extinct: and if a man hath title to enter into any Land, by ſuch Releaſe his title is gone: and 20 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 5. where in an Aſſiſe for Rent, a Releaſe of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands was pleaded, and the common Opinion was, that it was good; wherefore the Plaintiff was non-ſuited: and 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.42. by <hi>Danby:</hi> A Releaſe of all Demands by a Lord to his Tenant is a good bar and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment of his Seigniory; for although no Rent was behinde at the making of the Releaſe, yet is the Rent always in Demand: and 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. If the King releaſeth all Demands, yet as to him the Inheritance ſhall not be included: But in caſe of Rent or right of Entry by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, and every thing therein implyed, is gone by ſuch Releaſe: And 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 9. by <hi>Pollard:</hi> By Releaſe of all Demands the Rent is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, for Rent is to be had by Demand; and if one doth determine the means he hath to come by a thing, he doth determine the thing it ſelf: And <hi>Litt.</hi> 118. If a man hath a Rent-ſervice, or Rent-charge, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Paſture, by ſuch Releaſe of all Demands, all is gone from the Land from whence the Service or Rent is iſſuing, or the Common of Paſture: But if one lets Land to another for a year, rendering forty ſhillings Rent at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and before the Feaſt does releaſe to the Leſſee all Actions, yet after the Feaſt he ſhall have an Action of Debt for non-payment of the forty ſhillings notwithſtanding the Releaſe. And 40 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 48. <hi>Hillary:</hi> By ſuch Releaſe to the Conuſor of a Statute-Merchant before the day of payment, the Conuſee ſhall be barred of his Action, becauſe that the Duty is always in demand: yet if he releaſe all his right in the Land, it is no Bar: 25 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 7. And <hi>Althams</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cokes Rep.</hi> 153. By a Releaſe of all Demands, not onely all Demands, but alſo all cauſes of Demands are releaſed. And there are two manners of Demands, <hi>viz</hi> In Deed, and in Law. In Deed: As in every <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> there is an expreſs Demand. In Law: As in every Entry in Land, Diſtreſs for Rent, taking and ſeiſing of goods, and the like acts in <hi>Pais,</hi> which may be done without words, are Demands in Law. And as a Releaſe of Suits is more large and beneficial then a Releaſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints or Actions, ſo a Releaſe of Demands is more large and beneficial then any of them, for by that is releaſed all thoſe things that by the others are releaſed, and more; for thereby all Freeholds and Inheritances are releaſed: as in 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Releaſes</hi> 90. 6. He who does releaſe all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, does exclude himſelf of all Entries, Actions, and Seiſures: And <hi>Littl.</hi> 170. By the Releaſe of all Demands Warranty is releaſed, and yet that is Executory, and the reaſon hereof is, that by the Releaſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54307:68"/> all the means, remedies, and cauſes, that any hath to Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Goods or Chattels, are extinct, and by conſequence the right and intereſt in all of them. And in 40 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 22. It is debated there, whether a Releaſe of all Demands by the Lord to the Tenant, to hold onely by Rent and Fealty, ſhall bar the Lord to demand reaſonable ayd to marry his Daughter; but it was agreed there, that ſuch Releaſe ſhall bar the Lord of his Rent, for as it is there ſaid, that is always in demand. And 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Avowry</hi> 89. One gives Land in Tayl to hold by Rent, Homage and Fealty for all Services and Demands, this does diſcharge the Tenant of Relief, (but 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>contrarium tenetur.</hi>) And 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Avowry</hi> 211. Suit at a Leet by reaſon of Reſidency is not diſcharged by a Feoffment to hold by Rent for all Services and Demands, for this ſervice is not in reſpect of the Land, but of reſidency of the perſon. And 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Gilbert de Clare,</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> before the Statute of <hi>Quia Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptores Terrarum,</hi> did give Land, parcel of the Honor of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> to hold of him as of the Honor, to hold by Homage, Fealty and Rent for all Services and Demands: And after long argument it was agreed, and hereby the Lord was excluded to have a Fine for alienation, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was due from every Tenant of the Honor. And as the Fine was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged there by the Feoffment, ſo it might have been by Releaſe of all Demands.</p>
               <p>And the whole Court agreed,<note place="margin">Judicium.</note> that by this Releaſe of all Demands the Rent is releaſed, and ſo the Plaintiff ought to be barred: and ſo <hi>Paſch.</hi> 16 <hi>Jacob.</hi> Judgment was given accordingly.</p>

               <p>That the <hi>20</hi> of <hi>April, 5 Jacob.</hi> the ſaid <hi>William</hi> did ſail from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Barbary,</hi> and there the <hi>22 June, 5 Jacob.</hi> arrived, and did then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Plaintiff; and knowing the ſaid Iewels to be artificial and counterfeit, did ſhew them to the Plaintiff for good and true Iewels, and there and then did require the Plaintiff to ſell them for good and true Iewels to <hi>Mully Sydan</hi> then King of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and there &amp; then did affirm to the Plaintiff, that the ſaid Iewels were worth in value <hi>14400</hi> Dunces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony, amounting to <hi>810 l.</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mony. And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54307:69"/> the Plaintiff not ſuſpecting the ſaid Iewels to be counterfeit, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them to be good and true, did receive them of the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> and afterwards <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the <hi>22</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, 5 Jacob.</hi> did offer them to the ſaid King of <hi>Barbary</hi> as good and true Iewels, and there and then did procure the ſaid King to buy the ſaid Iewels (not being of the value of <hi>3000</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony, amounting to <hi>168 l. 15 s. Engliſh</hi>) for <hi>14400</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony, amounting to <hi>810 l.</hi> which mony the Plaintiff the <hi>22</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, 5 Jacob.</hi> received of the ſaid King for the ſaid Iewels for the Defendant, and did pay the ſaid ſum then there to the ſaid <hi>William</hi> for the Defendant; and the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the receit thereof, did ſecretly withdraw himſelf out of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> and did return into <hi>England</hi> to the Defendant with the ſaid ſum, and the firſt of <hi>October, 5 Jacob.</hi> did pay the ſame to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>30</hi> of <hi>May, 6 Jac.</hi> the ſaid King perceiving the ſaid Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to be counterfeit, cauſed the Plaintiff to be arreſted and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, and retained him in priſon three months, and until the Plaintiff out of his proper goods did repay to the ſaid King the ſaid <hi>14400</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony.</p>
               <p>That the firſt of <hi>October, 6 Jac.</hi> the Plaintiff gave notice to the Defendant of the repair of the ſaid <hi>William</hi> to him, and of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, and requeſted him to pay to the Plaintiff the ſaid ſum, which yet he hath not payd, <hi>ad damnum 2000</hi> Marks.</p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded Not guilty.</p>
               <p>The Iury found that the firſt of <hi>April, 5 Jac.</hi> the Defendant was poſſeſt of the ſaid Iewels, and knowing them to be artificial and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and intending fraudulently, for good and true Iewels did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to the ſaid <hi>William Sadock,</hi> and that it was then well known to the ſaid <hi>William</hi> that the ſaid Iewels were artificial and counterfeit, and that the Defendant did command the ſaid <hi>William</hi> that he ſhould tranſport the ſaid Iewels into <hi>Barbary,</hi> where he knew the Plaintiff did reſide; and did further give authority to the ſaid <hi>William</hi> to ſell the ſaid Iewels to the then King of <hi>Barbary,</hi> or to any other perſon that would buy them. And the Iury found that the ſaid <hi>William</hi> went into <hi>Barbary,</hi> and there, knowing the ſaid Iewels to be artificial and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, did ſhew them to the Plaintiff for good and true Iewels, and did requeſt the Plaintiff to ſell and utter them to the ſaid <hi>Mully Sydan</hi> for good and right Iewels for the Defendant, affirming to the Plaintiff that the ſaid Iewels were worth <hi>14400</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to <hi>810 l. Engliſh</hi> Mony, and that the Plaintiff not ſuſpecting the ſaid Iewels to be artificial and counterfeit, but conceiving them to be good and true Iewels, did receive them of the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them to be ſold to the ſaid King as good and true Iewels, and procured the ſaid King to buy them (not being of the value of <hi>3000</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony, amounting to <hi>168 l. 15 s.</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mony) for <hi>14400</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony, amounting to <hi>810 l. Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and the Plaintiff then and there did receive the ſaid ſum of the ſaid King for the ſaid Iewels for the Defendant, and payd the ſame to the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> who after the receit thereof immediately conveyed himſelf out of <hi>Barbary</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and did there pay the ſaid ſum to the Defendant: and that afterwards the ſaid King perceiving the ſaid Iewels to be artificial and counterfeit, cauſed the Plaintiff to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted and impriſoned, and detained him in priſon three months, until he had repayd to the ſaid King the ſaid <hi>14400</hi> Ounces of <hi>Barbary</hi> Mony
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54307:69"/> for the ſaid Iewels, and that the Plaintiff did give notice to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of all the ſaid premiſſes, and requeſted him to repay him the ſaid ſum as the Plaintiff had alledged. But they ſaid, that the Defendant did not command the ſaid <hi>William</hi> that he ſhould conceal the pravity or counterfeiting of the ſaid Iewels, or that he ſhould repair to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and ſhew him the ſaid Iewels for good and true Iewel, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Plaintiff to ſell or utter the ſaid Iewels to the ſaid King, or other perſon that would buy them: and that he received the price for them as for good and true Iewels, as by the Declaration is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>And if it ſeem to the Court upon the whole matter, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is guilty, they found for the Plaintiff, and did aſſign <hi>642 l.</hi> dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and four Marks coſts; and if not, then they found for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given againſt the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and that this Action does not lie againſt the Defendant, for four Reaſons.</p>
               <p>It does appear by the Plaintiffs own Declaration that theſe Iewels <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> were not counterfeit, but onely of a leſs value then the mony for which they were ſold: for although the plaintiff in his declaration termeth them to be counterfeit Iewels, yet he acknowledgeth them to be worth <hi>168 l. 15 s.</hi> or as neer that value as may be; for in as much as he averred them, not to be of the value of <hi>168 l. 15 s.</hi> this being his own aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt himſelf <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> that they were very near that value; and if they were of that value, it appears to the Court that they could not be counterfeit, although they were not of ſo great value as was payd for them: And the value and eſtimation of Iewels is always as the Buyer will account of them and eſteem them: as <hi>Michaelm. 38</hi> and <hi>39 Elizab. Common Bench:</hi> where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> brought an Action on the Caſe againſt <hi>Sympſon,</hi> wherein the Plaintiff declared, that he was poſſeſt of an Ewer of ſilver to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of <hi>500 l.</hi> and did give the ſame to <hi>A.</hi> to tranſport beyond Sea, and to ſell the ſame there, and to give an account thereof to him, and that <hi>A.</hi> had broken it, and converted it to his own uſe: whereupon the now Plaintiff brought his Action on the Caſe againſt <hi>A. ad damnum 500 l.</hi> whereupon they were at iſſue, and the Defendant did maliciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that it was worth but <hi>180 l.</hi> whereupon the Iury gave but <hi>200 l.</hi> damages: And adjudged that the Action would not lie, and chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the value of ſuch things are ſo uncertain, that ſome value them higher then others.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Verdict doth vary from the Declaration in three material points: <hi>1.</hi> The Defendant doth not direct his Servant to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. <hi>2.</hi> The Defendant did not command him to conceal the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitneſs of the Iewels. <hi>3.</hi> He did not command the Servant to ſell them as good Iewels.</p>
               <p>No Action on the Caſe lies, although this fact had been done by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Defendant himſelf: as <hi>11 Ed. 4. 6.</hi> If one ſells Clothes, and doth warrant them to be ſo long, and they are not, an Action on the Caſe lies; but there ought to be an expreſs warranty, and that ought to be made at the time of the ſale, or elſe no Action lies. And <hi>F. N. B. 94 C.</hi> If one doth ſell a Horſe, and warrant him to be ſound, and he is not, an Action lies: ſo if one ſells corrupt Wine, and warrants it to be good, an Action lies: but unleſs he warrant the Horſe or Wine to be good, no Action lies; for the Buyer is at his peril, and his eyes and his taſte
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54307:70"/> muſt be his judges in this caſe: and in <hi>7 H. 4. 14.</hi> The Plaintiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Defendant ſold corrupted Wine to him, knowing the ſame to be corrupted: the Defendant ſaid, that he gave the Plaintiff a taſte of the Wine, and that he agreed that it was good Wine, and adjudged the Action would not lie: and <hi>13 H. 4. 1.</hi> If one ſells a Horſe that is blinde, and warrants him to be ſound, no Action lies, becauſe I may ſee whether he be blinde or not; but otherwiſe, where he hath a diſeaſe in his body, which I cannot diſcern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montague.</hi> He ought to have ſhewed that he was legally impriſoned, and compelled to pay the Mony, for otherwiſe he cannot have an Action: as in <hi>13 H. 4. 6.</hi> A diverſity in ſale of things between thoſe things that are neceſſary, and not neceſſary, as Iewels: alſo the ſaid <hi>William</hi> was authorized by the Defendant to ſell the Iewels, and he cannot au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize another; and therefore that which the Plaintiff hath done, was without any warrant from the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Defendant did not require his Servant to conceal the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the ſaid Iewels, nor to requeſt the Plaintiff to ſell them, and therefore all that the Servant did to the Plaintiff was of his own voluntary act, for which he muſt anſwer, and not his Maſter; for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall anſwer for no acts of his Servant but thoſe which he does by his commandment: as <hi>9 H. 6. 53.</hi> by <hi>Rolphe:</hi> If I have a Servant who is my Merchant, and he goes to the Fair with an unſound Horſe, or other Merchandize, and ſells them, the Vendee can have no Action againſt me. <hi>Martin.</hi> You ſay true, for you do not command him to ſell the Horſe to him, nor to no other perſon in certain. <hi>Vide Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student 138.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It does not appear, that the Plaintiff was lawfully indemnified, for it is onely alledged and found, that he was impriſoned by the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, &amp;c. but it is not alledged or found, that this was done by a legal courſe, or according to the Law of that Country, but onely by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of that King, and therefore the Plaintiff can have no remedy, although there had been a Warranty: as <hi>Cook. 5 Rep. Noke</hi> and <hi>Anders</hi> Caſe: If Leſſee for years be outed by a ſtranger without title, he ſhall not have an Action of Covenant.</p>
               <p>And this Caſe was argued by <hi>Crook</hi> for the Plaintiff, and by me for the Defendant, <hi>29 Janua. 15 Jacob.</hi> at which time the Court ſeemed to incline againſt the Plaintiff: And <hi>Trinit. 16 Jacob.</hi> The caſe was argued by <hi>Davenport</hi> for the Plaintiff, and by <hi>Coventry</hi> the Kings So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor for the Defendant, at which time <hi>Montague, Doderidge,</hi> and <hi>Haughton</hi> agreed, that the Action would not lie, and <hi>Crook</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

               <p>IN an Action of Debt upon a Bond of 400 <hi>l.</hi> made the third of <hi>October,</hi> 12 <hi>Jacob.</hi> and the Defendant demanded <hi>Oyer</hi> of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and of the Condition; which was, <hi>That whereas the Plaintiff had deviſed to</hi> Robert Hawkins <hi>the Farm of</hi> Williamſthorp <hi>in the County of</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>until the Feaſt of St.</hi> Michael <hi>the Archangel next, if the ſaid</hi> Robert, <hi>upon the ſaid Feaſt day, or any time after, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made by the Plaintiff, his Heirs, or Aſſigns, ſhould deliver the

               </p>

               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</p>
               <p>For in <hi>Tookers</hi> Caſe, 2 <hi>Report,</hi> by <hi>Popham:</hi> Every act made by one Ioynt-tenant for the benefit of him and his companion, ſhall binde the other, as payment by one diſcharges the other; and one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the other in the profits: as where a Ward does happen to two Ioyn-tenants, and one diſtrains for the ſervices which is a waver of the Wardſhip, by 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. this ſhall binde the other.</p>
               <p>And if two Ioynt-tenants be diſſeiſed, and one enters, this is in Law the entry of both, and ſo it ſhall be pleaded; for when an act is made by one, the Law ſhall adjudg this to be made by him in whoſe right it is made: as in 32 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Bar</hi> 264. If one be bound to infeoff another ſuch a day, if he be ready by his Attorny to do it, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the Law takes the act of the Attorny to be the act of the party:

If there be two Ioynt-tenants in Fee, and one ſeiſed in right of his Wife, of Land to which the Wife hath title of Dower, the one Ioynt-tenant or the Husband may aſſign the Dower; and the reaſon is given, becauſe that when the Husband or one Ioynt-tenant does any thing out of Court that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to make, it ſhall be intended to be the Deed of the one and the other.</p>

               <p>And ſo here, the matter of the iſſue is, whether a legal requeſt of the delivery of the poſſeſſion was made or not? and if it were made by the Attorneys of the Bargainees, that in Law ſhall be taken to be the act of themſelves, and ſo ſhall be pleaded: and ſo was it adjudged in this Court, <hi>Hillar.</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Jordans</hi> Caſe: <hi>Vide Dyer</hi> 354.</p>

               <p>And I conceive that Iudgment ought to be given againſt the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, for in as much as the Defendant was ſworn of the Inqueſt, and he and the other Iurors upon good evidence did indict the Plaintiff, it cannot be preſumed that he did this on malice, but it was done in zeal to Iuſtice by reaſon of his oath: and although it be true that he and the other Defendants did procure the Plaintiff to be indicted of malice without juſt cauſe, yet now the oath of the Defendant hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himſelf of the precedent wrong, as may be proved by many Books: 21 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>a.</hi> In a Conſpiracy for indicting the Plaintiff of Felony, the Defendant pleaded that he was ſworn of the Inqueſt to enquire at the Leet of the Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> and that he and the reſt of the Iury did indict the Plaintiff upon their oath: and there <hi>Thorp</hi> ſaid, That Conſpirators are always in fault: and when one is of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſworn to ſpeak the truth, that which he ſaith then is upon his oath, and not of Conſpiracy; and there is no reaſon to accuſe one of Conſpiracy, where he does nothing.</p>
               <p>7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 31. In a Conſpiracy to procure the Plaintiff to be indicted of a Treſpaſs, the Defendant ſaid, That they were impannelled for the King before the Iuſtices of Peace in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and that which they did was upon their oaths: Iudgment, &amp;c. The Plaintiff replyed, that there was no ſuch Record, and becauſe the Defendants failed of the Record for two days, Iudgment was given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 6. The Defendants pleaded that they were indicted: the Plaintiff replyed, that they procured the Sheriff to return them. <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> There is no queſtion but that the Iurors ſhall be excuſed of Conſpiracy, by reaſon of their oaths: <hi>Vide</hi> 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 5. and 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 19. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 23. And <hi>Nat. Brevium</hi> 115. <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> it is put for a rule, that a Writ of Conſpiracy will not lie againſt the Indictors themſelves, and if Iurors be ſworn to enquire, &amp;c. and after ſome of them be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the Iuſtices, they ſhall not be puniſhed for any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it was when they were ſworn; but if they conſpire after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they may be charged with a Conſpiracy. And <hi>Stamford</hi> 173. if after the Conſpiracy the Conſpirators are ſworn on the Inqueſt to enquire, &amp;c. and they with the others of the Iury do indict him againſt whom they do conſpire, no Writ of Conſpiracy will lie againſt them, becauſe ſuch thing cannot be intended falſe or malicious, becauſe they do it on their oaths, and that with others beſides themſelves. The ſame Law where after the Conſpirators are ſworn and have ſpoken with their companions, they are diſcharged by the Iuſtices, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they were once ſworn, and the Conſpiracy therefore diſcharged. And Old Book of <hi>Entr.</hi> 122. a. In a Writ of Conſpiracy to procure the Plaintiff to be indicted of Felony, one of the Defendants plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Not guilty, and the other that he was one of the Indictors, in the ſame manner as our Plea is, without any <hi>Travers,</hi> and the Plaintiff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>nul tiel Record,</hi> upon which they were at iſſue, &amp;c. and in the ſame Book are four other preſidents, in all which the ſame Bars are pleaded.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54307:72"/> And there is alſo another preſident where the ſame Bar is pleaded; to which the Plaintiff replyed, that the Defendant after the conſpiracy of his Covin did procure the Sheriff to impannel and return him to be one of the Iury, to the intent that he ſhould indict the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Alſo this Indictment is inſufficient in other reſpects: 1. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, <hi>ad communem diſturbationem &amp; inquietatem omnium inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantium ibidem:</hi> the which word <hi>[ibidem]</hi> does refer onely to <hi>Edmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and ſo there is no common nuſance, but particularly to them of that Town. 2. There is no place alledged where he was a common Barretor. 3. The Indictment is, that he was a common Barretor, <hi>ita quod veriſimilis fuit facere homicidium, lites &amp; diſcordia, &amp; alia gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamina inter vicinos ſuos apud</hi> Edmunton <hi>praedict.</hi> which is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for that it ought to be alledged in fact, that he made or cauſed <hi>lites &amp; diſcordia,</hi> and not that he was like to make them.</p>
               <p>And if an Indictment be inſufficient, although that the party does plead Not guilty and be acquitted, yet he ſhall not have a Conſpiracy or an Action on the Caſe, for by ſuch Indictment he cannot be in any danger: and 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 12. If one be indicted on an inſufficient Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he does not take advantage thereof, but pleads not guilty, and is acquitted, and brings a Writ of Conſpiracy, the Defendants may ſhow how that the Indictment was inſufficient, ſo that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was not duly arraigned, and they ſhall have advantage thereof: <hi>Vide Cook.</hi> 4 <hi>Rep. Vaux</hi> Caſe. And 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 9. If the party indicted be miſnamed, and be acquitted, he ſhall not have a Conſpiracy becauſe the Indictment was voyd as to him. And <hi>Dyer</hi> 286. If the offence in the Indictment be pardoned by a general pardon, and yet the party pleads Not guilty, and is acquitted, he ſhall not have a Conſpiracy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was in no jeopardy.</p>
               <p>And this Caſe being moved by <hi>Chilborn</hi> Serjeant, and <hi>George Crook</hi> for the Plaintiff, the fourth of <hi>February,</hi> 15 <hi>Jacob.</hi> I ſhewed to the Court, that the Plea was good, for the reaſons and authorities afore cited, and alſo that the Indictment was inſufficient for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons afore ſhewed.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Caſe.</note>And the Caſe upon the whole matter I conceive to be this:</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Lock</hi> being ſeiſed of certain Land in Fee, and being Ioynt-tenant with <hi>Matthew Lock,</hi> one of his Sons, of Copyhold Land within the ſame Town, had iſſue <hi>Henry, Michael, Thomas,</hi> and two other Sons, and by his Will did deviſe to his Sons divers Lands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally: And after ſays, <hi>Touching my Lands at</hi> T. <hi>my Son</hi> Matthew <hi>is joyned Purchaſer with me already of the moſt, and the reſt of all my Land there, which is Freehold, I give to</hi> Henry <hi>and</hi> Michael, <hi>upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if they ſell it to any but to</hi> Matthew <hi>my Son, then he to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as of my Gift:</hi> and then he declares, <hi>That of all theſe Bequeſts his Sons ſhall bear part and part-like, out of all his Copyhold Lands and Free, to pay to</hi> Elizabeth <hi>his wife for her Dowry 40 l. a year during her life; and that Son which ſhall refuſe to bear his part, ſhall not enjoy any part of his Bequeſt, but it ſhall be to the reſidue, &amp;c.</hi> Sir <hi>William Lock</hi> dyes, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> enter, and pay their parts of the <hi>40 l. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> dyes, and then <hi>Michael</hi> dyes: And now the Queſtion is, Whether the Defendants, being Heirs of <hi>Michael,</hi> ſhall have the Land, or the Plaintiffs, who claim under the Deviſor?</p>
               <p>And for the better arguing of this Caſe: I will firſt obſerve, that here is not any expreſs words of limitation of an Eſtate, to make any greater Eſtate to paſs then an Eſtate for life: and then I will ſhew, that here are no words in any part of this Will to ſignifie any certain intention in the Deviſor to make an Eſtate of Inheritance to paſs by this Deviſe.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, the Deviſe is onely to his two ſons: <hi>viz. The reſt of all my Houſes and Lands there, which is Freehold, I give to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Michael Lock:</hi> and theſe are all the words of limitation of the Eſtate; and theſe, without queſtion, in a Deed or Feoffment, will not make a greater Eſtate then for life. And ſo is <hi>Littleton 1.</hi> If one purchaſe Land <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> or to him and his Aſſigns <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> this is but an Eſtate for life, becauſe it wants theſe words, <hi>his Heirs,</hi> which words make the Inheritance in all Feoffments and Grants; and this is an infallible Rule in Grants, unleſs it be in ſome ſpecial Caſes, as in Frankmarriage or Frankalmoine, which being words of art, do paſs an Inheritance with theſe words, <hi>Heirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in Caſes of Grants, no intention of the Grantor, although it be apparent in the Grant, will make an eſtate of Inheritance to paſs: as in <hi>19 H. 6. 73. 20 H. 6. 36.</hi> A Gift to <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C. &amp; haeredibus,</hi> with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty to them and their Heirs, is no Fee-ſimple, becauſe the words
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54307:73"/> of limitation are incertain to whom <hi>haeredibus</hi> ſhall be referred, and ſo all one as if it were omitted: and then the clauſe of Warranty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it does declare a certain intent to give an Eſtate in Fee, will not amend the matter in a Grant. And ſo in the <hi>1 Rep. Shelleys</hi> Caſe: if one gives Land to one, <hi>&amp; liberis,</hi> or <hi>eitibus ſuis,</hi> or <hi>ſemini ſuo,</hi> it is but an Eſtate for life, and not an Eſtate in Tayl, yet there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent intent, but that will not ſuffice in a Grant.</p>
               <p>But I agree, that in Caſe of a Deviſe, although the apt words to make an Eſtate of Inheritance to paſs are omitted, yet if the intent of the Deviſor does appear by any expreſs matter contained in the Will, an Eſtate of Inheritance ſhall paſs, for it is ſufficient to paſs the Inheritance. And ſo <hi>Litt. 133. 6. 19 H. 8. 9. 6.</hi> If one deviſeth Land to another <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> the Deviſe by theſe words ſhall bar an Eſtate in Fee: ſo if one deviſe Land to another, to give, diſpoſe, or ſell at his pleaſure, this is an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple: <hi>19 H. 8. 9. 6. 7 Edw. 6. B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet the Law hath reſtrained ſuch intent.</p>
               <p>For firſt, it ought to be agreeable to Law, and not repugnant to it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for although in <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> Caſe, in the <hi>Comment.</hi> it is ſaid, that a Will is like to an Act of Parliament, yet a Will cannot alter the Law, or make a new form of an Eſtate, which is not allowed by the Rules of Law, as an Act of Parliament is: and ſo adjudged in the Common Bench, <hi>Hillar. 37 Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Jermin</hi> and <hi>Aſcot, Cooks 1 Rep. 85.</hi> in <hi>Corbets</hi> Caſe: That by a Deviſe a man cannot give an Eſtate, and determine part thereof by a condition, and make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue to continue. And if Land be deviſed to one in Tayl, he cannot determine the Eſtate as to the Deviſee himſelf, and yet preſerve the Eſtate to the iſſue: as was endeavoured in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>28</hi> and <hi>29 H. 8. Dyer 33.</hi> If Land be deviſed to one in Fee, and if he does not perform ſuch an Act, the Land ſhall remain to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the remainder is voyd, for no ſuch remainder can be limited by the Rules of Law.</p>
               <p>This intent ought to be expreſt in the Will, and collected out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the words of the Will, and cannot be averred or ſupplyed by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign matter, as in <hi>Matthew Mannings</hi> Caſe, <hi>8 Rep. 95. 6.</hi> Always the intention of the Deviſor, expreſſed in his Will, is the beſt Expoſitor, Director, and Diſpoſer of his words. And Lord <hi>Cheyreys</hi> Caſe, <hi>5 Rep. 68.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Cheyrey</hi> deviſed certain Land to <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, and the Heirs males of his body, the remainder to <hi>Thomas Cheyrey</hi> of <hi>Woodley,</hi> and the Heirs males of his body, upon condition, <hi>That he or they or any of them ſhall not alien:</hi> and the Queſtion was, whether there could be an averment, that the intent of the Deviſor was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain <hi>H.</hi> and his Heirs from aliening? and reſolved that no ſuch aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be received, for conſtruction of Wills ought to be collected out of the words of the Will.</p>
               <p>The intent of the Deviſor ought to be manifeſt and certain, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> dubious, as in a Deviſe of Land to one for ever, here the intent is to give an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple, for no other Eſtate can continue for ever: ſo if the deviſe be to one and his Heirs, and if he dyes without Heir, that it ſhall remain to another, his intent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars, that the word <hi>His</hi> in the firſt Deviſe ſhall be taken for the Heirs of his body; for the Law will ſooner preſume him to be dead without iſſue, then to be dead without Heir.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:54307:74"/>
               <p>And now to examine our Caſe with the Rules of Law: There are three clauſes in this Will, as I conceive, upon which the pretences of the Defendants are founded to have an Eſtate in Fee paſs by this Deviſe, to which I ſhall make anſwer ſeverally.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The precedent clauſe to the Deviſe: <hi>And as touching my Lands at</hi> T. <hi>my Son</hi> Matthew <hi>is joyned Purchaſer with me of the moſt, and the reſt of all my Houſes and Lands there, which is Freehold, I give to</hi> Henry <hi>and</hi> Michael Lock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to this, I conceive that here is no colour to enlarge the Eſtate to the Deviſees, but this clauſe is onely a deſcription of Land which he does not intend to deviſe, and which in truth he cannot deviſe, becauſe that <hi>Matthew</hi> ought to have it by ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and is principally named therein, becauſe of preventing any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between <hi>Matthew</hi> and the two Deviſees after his death; for otherwiſe they might perhaps have pretended that all the Land in <hi>T.</hi> ſhould paſs to them eſpecially, becauſe they were purchaſed as it might, very well be preſumed, with the mony of the Deviſor, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted owner thereof, but theſe words make no Declaration as to the Eſtate which he intends to demiſe to <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Condition or limitation annexed to the Deviſe, in theſe words: <hi>Upon condition, that if they ſell it to any man but to</hi> Matthew Lock <hi>my Son, then he to enter upon it as of my gift, by this my Will:</hi> and I conceive that this clauſe does not ſhew any intent of the Deviſor to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Eſtate firſt limited to <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Michael,</hi> or to give an Eſtate in Fee to them; for it is not if they alien in Fee or in Tail, or if they or their Heirs do alien, which words, or any words to ſuch intent, would have declared a manifeſt intention that the Deviſees ſhould have a Fee-ſimple: but here an alienation in general onely is reſtrained, which ought to be taken for a legal alienation, and ſuch a one as they may make by reaſon of the Eſtate deviſed to them.</p>
               <p>And that it ſhall be ſo intended, firſt, it is to be conſidered, that this condition is a reſtraint annexed to the Eſtate, and is as a Convinct to the Eſtate, and therefore cannot be properly more large then the Eſtate it ſelf: for it is a Rule, that every reſtraint or exception in an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ought to operate upon the Eſtate, or the thing before granted: as in the <hi>Comment. 370. Zouches</hi> Caſe: An exception is an exemption of that contained in the general words, and if it be not contained in the generality, it can be no exception in the ſpecialty, and therefore if one doth leaſe <hi>W.</hi> acre, excepting <hi>B.</hi> acre, the exception is vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This exception of alienation is more proper to be annexed to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for life, then in fee; for he who makes a Leaſe for life or years, may reſtrain the Leſſee by condition, that he ſhall not alien, but the Feoffor cannot reſtrain the Feoffe from aliening: as in <hi>Littleton 84.</hi> If a Feoffment be made on condition that the Feoffee ſhall not alien, the Condition is voyd, for the Feoffee hath power to alien to whom he will, for if that condition were good, that would take from him the power which the Law gives him, which would be againſt Reaſon: but if the Condition be, that he ſhall not alien to ſuch a perſon, naming the perſon, or any of his Heirs or his iſſues, this is a good Condition, becauſe it take not away the power to alien in Fee. And <hi>Vernons</hi> Caſe, <hi>4 Rep. fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 3.</hi> An Eſtate in Fee, conveyed by the Husband or his Anceſtor to a woman for her Ioynture, is not a Ioynture within the Statute of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi> which reſtrains alienations made by women: for to reſtrain ſuch an Eſtate as cannot be aliened, is repugnant and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54307:74"/> againſt the Rule of Law, and therefore not within the intention of the Act.</p>
               <p>But it hath been objected on the other ſide; <hi>1.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> That this Condition is not voyd, becauſe it doth not reſtrain all their power, but leaves them to the liberty to alien to <hi>Matthew. 2.</hi> If the condition be voyd, yet it is ſufficient to declare the intent of the Deviſor that a Fee ſhould paſs.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt, I conceive that the condition is voyd; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain generally, and that he ſhall not alien to any but to <hi>J. S.</hi> is all one: for then the Feoffor may reſtrain him from aliening to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to himſelf, or ſuch other perſon by name, whom he may well know cannot, nor never will, purchaſe the Land: So that this condition ſhall take away all his power, and ſhall make a perpetuity in the Feoffee, which is quite contrary to Law, neither is there any authority to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant this reſtraint: for <hi>Littleton</hi> leaves the Feoffee at liberty to alien to any, except to ſuch a one in particular.</p>
               <p>And as to the ſecond, I do agree, That if the condition to reſtrain the alienation had been expreſly to reſtrain the Deviſees and their Heirs, or to have reſtrained from aliening in Fee or in Tayl, or for anothers life, although the condition had been voyd, yet had it been ſufficient to have ſhewn the intent of the Deviſor, and to have cauſed an Eſtate in Fee to have paſſed. And therefore I do agree to the caſe in the <hi>9 Rep. fol. 127.</hi> where one deviſed to his Wife for life, and after her deceaſe his Son <hi>William</hi> to have it, and if <hi>William</hi> ſhall have iſſue male, that he ſhall have it, and if he have not iſſue male, his Son <hi>S.</hi> ſhall have it, and if he hath iſſue male, his Son ſhall have it, with like Remainders to his other Sons; and my Will is, <hi>If any of my Sons, or their Heirs males, iſſues of their bodies, alien, then the next Heir to enter, &amp;c.</hi> And it was reſolved, That the Son ſhould have an Eſtate in Tayl by this Deviſe: Firſt, by reaſon of theſe words, <hi>If he have no iſſue male,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he dye without iſſue male. Secondly, becauſe he and his Heirs males are reſtrained to alien: for every reſtraint (eſpecially in Wills) does imply, that the party, in caſe he were not reſtrained, had power of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. And ſo <hi>Bakers</hi> Caſe, <hi>Hillary 42 Eliz. Rot. 143.</hi> A Deviſe to the Husband and Wife, the Remainder to their two Sons, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if they or their Heirs go about to alien, &amp;c. is a Fee-ſimple alſo; for the Heirs being reſtrained to alien, does ſhew fully, that the Heir ſhall have the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd, for otherwiſe he cannot alien it.</p>
               <p>But here in our condition, there are not any words to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Deviſor, that an Eſtate in Fee ſhall paſs, but the Deviſees are reſtrained to alien generally, which, as already I have ſhewed, is more agreeable to an Eſtate for life, then an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple, at the leaſt he does not ſhew any certain intent, that the Deviſees ſhall have an Eſtate in Fee, but that remains dubious, and therefore the ſafe way is to take the ſame according to the Rules of Law.</p>
               <p>The third clauſe to explain the intent of the Deviſor in this caſe is the clauſe of the Charge impoſed upon the Land by the Deviſor, <hi>viz. Item, All the Lands I have given joyntly betwixt my Sons, is, that they ſhall bear part and part-like, going out of all my Lands, as well Free as Copyhold, to pay to my Wife</hi> Elizabeth <hi>for Dowry 40 l. every year during her life out of all my Lands, &amp;c.</hi> And I conceive, that this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54307:75"/> clauſe makes nothing as to the enlargement of the Eſtate; and yet I do agree,<note place="margin">29 H. 8. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament 18. 4 Ed. 6. Eſtates 78.</note> That if one deviſe Land to another, paying <hi>20 l.</hi> or another ſum in groſs, this is a good Deviſe in Fee; but it is otherwiſe when the Land is deviſed to one paying an annual Rent, or bearing an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual charge with the profits thereof: as in <hi>Colliers</hi> Caſe, <hi>6 Rep.</hi> where one deviſed Land to his Wife, and with the profits that ſhe ſhould bring up his Daughter, and that after her death the Eſtate ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to his Brother, paying to other perſons <hi>40 s.</hi> and the value of the Land was <hi>3 l. per annum;</hi> and agreed there, that the Brother had a Fee-ſimple: and this diverſity was reſolved in that caſe, That if the Deviſe had been to the Brother, to the intent that he ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Daughter with the profits, or pay out of the profits thereof ſo much to one, and ſo much to another, that this is but an Eſtate for life, for he is ſure to have no loſs; ſo is it, if it be to pay certain ſums yearly under the value of the Land, for he may pay it out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and is ſure to be no loſer. And this is in effect our very caſe: For firſt, the Charge is impoſed for Dower, which cannot be intended to exceed the annual value of the Land: Secondly, it is to be payd out of the Land, and therefore there is no charge impoſed upon the perſon of the Deviſee, but onely upon the Land deviſed to him, ſo that he takes the Land with this charge, and when his Eſtate determines in the Land, yet the charge does always remain upon the Land, and the Deviſee is diſcharged thereof; and therefore this charge may as well be, if he have an Eſtate for life, as if he have a Fee-ſimple. And as to that in <hi>Boraſtons</hi> Caſe, <hi>3 Rep. fo. 20. b.</hi> between <hi>W. Allock</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> where a Copyholder deviſed his Land, paying to his Daughter and to each of his younger Sons <hi>40 s.</hi> within two years after his death, and ſurrendered accordingly, and dyed; and agreed, that the Deviſee had an Eſtate in Fee, although the annual profits exceeded the mony that was to be payd; and the Reaſon is plain, for it is not limited to be payd out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e Land or profits, but is a payment in groſs, and it may happen that the Deviſee may dye before he can receive ſo much of the profits.</p>
               <p>And afterwards, <hi>viz. Trinit. 17 Jacob.</hi> All the Barons, <hi>(ſcil.) Tanfield, Bromley,</hi> and <hi>Denham,</hi> delivered their Opinions ſeverally, That <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Michael Lock</hi> had an Eſtate onely for their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no expreſs words in the Deviſe to make any greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to paſs; and the condition or clauſe of the charge impoſed by the Wtill, does not neceſſarily imply, that they ſhould have a greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtae then for life, for ſuch Eſtate may ſatisfie both theſe clauſes, as well as an Eſtate in Fee, and the condition is more proper to be annext to an Eſtate for life, then in Fee.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Judgment.</note>Wherefore they reſolved, That Iudgment ſhould be given for the Plaintiffs: but becauſe Sir <hi>Thomas Muſchamp,</hi> one of the Plaintiffs, dyed, hanging the Action, no Iudgment could be enter'd.</p>

               <p>And herein I will not ſtand at this time to argue, whether the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom will warrant this By-law, becauſe there hath been a reſolution in the Caſe in the 8 <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 125. for <hi>London;</hi> onely I obſerve that the Cuſtoms of <hi>London</hi> are confirmed by Act of Parliament, but ſo are not the Cuſtoms of <hi>Exeter.</hi>

               <p>But admitting that the Cuſtom will warrant this By-law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain a legal Trade or Art within the ſaid City, yet I conceive this By-law is utterly voyd for three cauſes; and if it were good, yet have not the Defendants purſued the ſame, in taking and ſelling of the goods, and that for two cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And as to the firſt, the Defendants have exceeded their Cuſtom in the extent of this By-law as to the place, for the Society of the Art is alledged to be within the City of <hi>Exeter;</hi> and then they alledg the Cuſtom to be, <hi>That they have uſed to make By-laws for the better Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and profit of the ſaid City;</hi> ſo that all the Cuſtom is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the City: but the By-law does exceed this, for it is, <hi>That none ſhall make, ſell, or offer to ſell any Shooes, &amp;c. within the City or the County of Exon;</hi> the which is not warranted by the Cuſtom: as in 5 <hi>Rep. Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London's</hi> Caſe, it was ordained, That if any
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54307:76"/> Citizen or ſtranger ſhould ſend any Cloth to ſell within the City before it ſhall be brought to <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> to be viewed and ſearched, this is reſolved to be good, although it do binde a ſtranger: but the reaſon thereof is given, becauſe the offence is committed within the City; whereupon I obſerve, that they can make no Order to extend without the City.</p>
               <p>This By-law does exceed their power in the things prohibited, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> that in two things: Firſt, That none ſhall make any Boots, Shooes, &amp;c. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> within the City or County, whereby every man is reſtrained to make ſuch things for his own uſe, or for his Maſter or Family, and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint is clearly againſt Law and Reaſon: for although that Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Trades in Cities and Towns are allowed by the Law, yet they cannot by any Cuſtom reſtrain a man from making any thing pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Art for his private uſe: and therefore if this By-law had been, That none ſhould uſe the Art of a Shoomaker within the City, this had been good; but to reſtrain any, that he may not make Shooes for himſelf within the City, this is voyd. <hi>Vide Cooks</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 129. <hi>Wagons</hi> Caſe: where it was reſolved, That he might make Candles for his own uſe; and ſo every one may bake and brew for their own uſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Defendants have not alledged any Cuſtom, That none ſhall make any Shooes, &amp;c. within the City, &amp;c. except thoſe of the Society, but onely that they may make By-laws for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and profit of the Society of the Art; and the making of Shooes for ones private uſe is nothing concerning their Society: and this is proved by the reſolution in the ſaid Caſe, and by the Statute of the fifth of <hi>Elizab.</hi> That none ſhall uſe any Art, in which he hath not been educated as Apprentice for ſeven years; yet it is lawful for any to bake or brew, or to make any manufacture for his private uſe, without any offence to the Statute. So <hi>Cooks</hi> 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 125. Sir <hi>George Farmers</hi> Caſe: He as Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Torceſter</hi> did preſcribe to have a Bakehouſe, and no other Baker ſhould ſell bread there, this was a good Cuſtom, but to reſtrain any from baking for himſelf cannot be a good Cuſtom. And the Caſe of the <hi>Taylors</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> 11 <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 55.

               <p>This By-law does reſtrain other perſons to uſe their Arts; for it is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That none ſhall do any thing pertaining to the Art of Shoomakers: and it is apparent, that many things do pertain to the Art of a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, which are to be done by other Artificers; for all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Art which of neceſſity muſt be uſed with the Art, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Art cannot be uſed; as Leather, which is to be made by the Tanner; Laſts, which are to be made by the Laſt-maker; Auls, by the Smith; Threed, and divers other things: and all theſe by this By-law are prohibited, not onely to be ſold, but alſo to be made by any not being of their Society.</p>
               <p>The penalty impoſed by this By-law, is not warranted by the Law, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nor by their Cuſtom, for that ought to be reaſonable, and ought to be expreſt, to the end that the Court may judg whether it be reaſonable or not: and therefore it is reſolved in <hi>Wagons</hi> Caſe, That the Pain ought to be reaſonable, 1. In reſpect of the manner thereof; and therefore it ought not to be by impriſonment, for that is againſt <hi>Magna
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54307:77"/> Charta, cap.</hi> 29. as it was adjudged in <hi>Clarks</hi> Caſe, 5 <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 64. 2. In regard of the quality: and therefore it is much debated in <hi>Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Caſe, if the penalty of 5 <hi>l.</hi> were reaſonable or not: but here no certain penalty is ſet down, but left to the diſcretion of any of the Shoomakers of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and that is againſt the courſe of all Laws; for when a Law is made, it is neceſſary that the penalty thereof ſhould be known, to the end men might not offend.</p>
               <p>But admitting this Order to be good, yet have not the Defendants purſued the ſame in the taking of this Diſtreſs, and that for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> They have diſtrained before their time, for the Order is, <hi>That if any refuſe to pay the ſum aſſeſſed, that then upon due proof thereof they may diſtrain, &amp;c.</hi> and then they plead, <hi>that the refuſal of the Plaintiff to pay the ſame, was duly proved before the Maſter and Wardens,</hi> which is inſufficient: for when it is ſaid, <hi>upon due proof,</hi> this is intended upon proof by Verdict: as in 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 11. On a Bond with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if the Obligor proves that it was the will of <hi>A.</hi> that <hi>B.</hi> ſhall make an Eſtate to the Obligor, &amp;c. this proof muſt be by Verdict: but if it be to be proved before <hi>J. S.</hi> there it is ſufficient to produce wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that will teſtifie the ſame: and ſo in the fourth and fifth of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> where <hi>Buckland</hi> was bound to the Lord <hi>Ewers,</hi> to produce before the ſaid Lord ſufficient witneſſes to diſcharge a certain debt due by <hi>B.</hi> to the Lord: and he pleaded, that he produced <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> before the ſaid Lord, and that they proved, that he did not ow the ſaid Debt; and agreed to be no good Plea, becauſe he did not ſhew how the proof was made before the ſaid Lord.</p>
               <p>So that this Plea is utterly inſufficient, 1. Becauſe no ſuch proof can be made before the Maſter and Wardens, as is intended by the Order. 2. Becauſe the Defendants have not ſhewn how the proof was made, ſo that the Court might judg whether it were ſufficient or not: and ſo in 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 40. the Lord <hi>Liſles</hi> Caſe: upon a Bond, that if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſhewed ſufficent diſcharge of a Rent, &amp;c. who pleaded that he did offer to ſhew a ſufficient diſcharge, and agreed to be no Plea, for he ought to ſhew what diſcharge, that the Court might judg thereof.</p>
               <p>So in the ninth <hi>Report,</hi> Caſe of the Abbot of <hi>Strata Marcella, fol.</hi> 34. in a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> the Defendant pleaded, that the Abbot had and uſed divers liberties, which he could not have without a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and reſolved no Plea, unleſs by reaſon of the Statute of the 32 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. for reviving of Liberties.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The Order is, <hi>That upon refuſal to pay the penalty, and upon proof thereof, the Maſter, &amp;c. may enter into the Houſe, Booth, Shop, Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or Cellar of the Offendor, and there to diſtrain any of his goods, &amp;c.</hi> And the Defendants have not averred, that theſe goods were taken in any of the ſaid places, but onely at the City of <hi>Exeter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Judgment.</note>And at laſt it was adjudged that the Plea was not good.</p>
